from the library of congress
and the smithsonian national museum of
african american history and culture
can i start with you and your name
darryl
if you could say your full given if you
would please daryl robertson
gregory hicks carol cummings boris
robert l hicks charles r hicks
valera p hicks barbara
hicks collins the oldest daughter of
robert and valeria hicks
i am uh joe manye of the southern oral
history program at the university of
north carolina at chapel hill
we're in bogalusa bogalusa louisiana
with the hicks family on
friday the 27th 2011
to do an oral history interview for the
civil rights history project which is an
undertaking of the
library of congress in partnership and
collaboration with the
smithsonian's national museum of african
american and history
we all want to say thank you very much
for welcoming us and we're very pleased
to be here so thank you all i know it's
an effort to get here and we appreciate
it
um as we've said we'll just have a
conversation about
all of this fascinating and complex
history mrs could i ask you just to
start
if if you like with um a word or two
about
um your recollections of of life with
your husband and
children in bogalusa late 50s early 60s
just before things really start to heat
up
well seemed like things has always been
bad with us
someone asked uh why did my husband do
all the things that he did and
it's because someone had to do it
and our thing is why did we wait so long
to start
but uh my husband was a
very smart man and he planned
before he would do something he'd sit
down and make a plan
not like his wife i'll just jump up and
do
but uh bob as i call him bob
was always a plan a very very smart me
and a very good provider
husband and father and someone i love
very much
um anyone else perhaps like to share a
sort of family
focused thought about your dad yeah you
know
i thought of my dad as
just a wonderful man and i think for me
the important thing
was to a degree knowing him before
the civil rights movement and then
knowing him after i learned
many things that he did but for me
one of the interesting things about my
dad was that
he was a black man who had time for his
family
and in a situation in this country where
so often
uh many blacks grow up without a father
uh we grew up in a family where we had a
dad
a father who was there all the time and
we were in a family where things happen
and we did it as a family sometimes i
think about how lucky
we were because in many situations if
you're black and you're
a black male you're lucky if you have a
father but in many situations
uh when there is a father in the house
uh
black daughters have a daddy and a
father and what i mean by that is that a
father
is somebody who makes you behave and
disciplines you and do all that
he does that for all his children but
then usually a father takes time
and he's adapted to the to the girls and
you hear women say all the time
my daddy and black boys don't usually
get a daddy
but a daddy is somebody who takes you
fishing uh when you're growing up
he would come home and he'd put us on
his back and he'd buck and
replay horses and just do all these
wonderful things
and it all didn't just happen when we
were children
you know he was a daddy throughout my
entire life in terms of being
there uh you know it was a daddy that
when i was
uh 23 years old had gone to the d.c to
the democratic convention
in chicago and the riots were going on
and my parents were worried about me
and when i when they picked me up i was
full of tear gas and the first thing my
daddy did was hug me and kiss me
and so for me i was lucky enough not
only to have a father but i had a daddy
as a black man
and so that just shows you kind of
exceptional man he was and i think
the part of that was that not only was
he that for me
but for so many people in our community
he was at so many boys and girls in the
community and i know my brothers and
sisters have other
comments also so i'm going to cut right
there
i raw have too much commerce
anybody want to maybe suggest some
thoughts about um
your recollections of bogalusa just as
young people coming up just before um
just before the
protest and movement momentum really
began to gather
the nature of of being a young person
here in bogalusa
i can remember of an incident when we
wanted to go to the movie
and we always had to go upstairs we
could never sit down i said i want to
sit down here so
i did talk to bob about it and jack and
we talked about it and that was
you know before we started the movement
and then he said one day you will be
able to sit in the way you want to sit
and you know that kind of stuck in my
mind so
during the time doing the movement then
you know i remember that
there oh well
the i guess the memories of
the younger days was
the hands-on things he taught taught me
because i was always interested in
changing all and
building on this and he's fixing this
and you know didn't have the i guess the
resources to
pay somebody to do it so it was always
like okay we can we can take this
challenge on let's let's see
let's let's tear it apart we had what
the volkswagens back in the days that
you know you had to they beetles just
were beetles and they would get you down
the street and stop so you had to
take your knife out and reset the points
so i'll take a plug out and clean it
and that's why i learned how to do a lot
of mechanicing and
a lot of like greg a lot of
cognitive work because the old house
basically we you know all of us kind of
pitched in
and we built it yeah he when he got off
at two o'clock
he eat or whatever and we get in the
truck and we come down here and we put
up
five or six sheets of paneling and
do molding and
the dark and then he say okay let's go
and then just
all i guess all the things that he
taught me
i still pass on to my son trying to
teach him
to that it's a lot of things that
just simple things that it looks
complicated that
if you really step back from it and look
at it it's really simple
well i i guess i realize this is all
about
about pop uh because of the things that
he accomplished things that he did
in his lifetime but when i remember
and go back uh to the early days it has
always been as charles said i like the
way charles sort of started off with
some of the things he said
because it's always been about family
about mom and dad
they've always been here and we got i
got very far memory
uh me and daryl was uh two of the
youngest
so uh when i think about the beginning i
think about
the fun and the happiness we had we had
a good we had a happy family
uh probably didn't realize some of the
issues and some of the uh complexity of
uh that was going on in bogalusa and
outside of bogalusa
at the time because mom and dad did such
a great job of keeping us happy here
but when i think about it when now that
i'm older
and i i have the time to reflect back
and think about it i think i'm
a dad in in stages that's when i was
young and
growing up and uh the things we did as
chauncey and daryl said
he taught us things he taught us value
and then uh
civil rights movement i i could think
about the things that he did during
those times
but the most amazing thing about
about this family is it's not what i
experienced growing up
as a young kid or a young child
or a young adult but as i became my
older man
and i listened to people say to talk
about the things that mom and dad
that dad had done that we never even
heard of before
they said uh that he did they said the
ways he helped people
uh some of the the the strong beliefs he
had in
in people uh it was amazing because
i hadn't heard those things before and
it's still
not completely shocking because you have
to know the man
he was always a good man and
some of the things that people reveal uh
they had his funeral and time after that
they come up and talk about
made you realize that that you you
wasn't wrong in your
your conception of and he was a very
good man because of the
the things that people testify that he
does and
and that's the way i remember i i got
pop i remember popping stages
and my belief and
really strong belief in in the way it
was came really how this death
and things were revealed to me let's
pause for just a sec because
somebody's at the door
okay we're back on after a short break a
little reconfiguration
which should be a little more
comfortable that's great i think some
folks had thoughts that they were
involved um
i'm the emotional one
of the group um
and my father only
passed a year and a month or so
and so it's uh it's kind of emotional
thing for me
um but i think
i think we had a special kind of
communication um
we communicated with our eyes
we communicated from our hearts
i knew exactly what my daddy was all
about
and he knew what i was all about
at least that's what i thought until he
passed
and then i realized when he passed that
he was a giant and i lived with the
giant and i didn't know it
and everything
everything that i thought
a man should be or to stand for that was
my dad
all the time in everything and
everything that he did
so um
just a little heart just a little heart
uh now he wasn't as emotional as i am
you know i got a lot of things from him
but uh i didn't get that from him
but uh very strong
he was really truly
my daddy and a man
rob did you want to say something new
well i learned a lot of things
from my father one of the main things is
he always said i always have a plan
always and he told me and he was
he had a lot of honest faith he said
don't do that
to that person if you don't expect him
to do it you say always
he taught me about a lot of values how
to be honest and trustworthy and all
that
most important so you know
those are some of the things that i
picked up on and that
i live with
i have one more thing i would like to
say also
that um i really i like the way he
expressed himself to the family
and then after i had children then my
children learn to
respect him and they say well i have a
problem oh let's call uncle bob and see
what he would say and he passed the
values that he gave to us onto our
children
and he just always made
when people walked in the house if it's
the first time you came in here you
always felt welcome and i think that
just spread it all through it so when
you know someone come in my house i
always say you have to make them feel
welcome
and you can never do too much for your
guests that's in your home
and i i just think him for so many when
i think about the va
so many values and things he taught us
and
sharing he shared all this with our
children which was great
you were talking about black life uh
and for me what i can remember about
black life in bogalusa
as a child and actually i guess almost
up until
i graduated was that we lived in two
separate worlds
and maybe part of it was we didn't know
how bad of things were because we were
children and
uh we had what we had we had our schools
we had our proms we had our football
games we had all of
all our things uh we had movies i mean
they were segregated but
the movies that the white saw we saw too
they were downstairs and we were
upstairs
we went
shopping we had places we shop
some of the things that i sometimes try
to remember back to it's like
i don't know when we could try on shoes
uh
in bogalusa but i remember at one point
i think that we
cut our barber and i was talking about
this they took a
piece of paper and cut it around and we
got shoes but then at some point
i remember that i could just go into us
to the store and put on a pair of shoes
i don't know when that transition
happened but you know
uh black lights from bogalusa
uh when i think about working in
situations and i can reflect on
a working situation for my parents and
other black people there were different
kinds of jobs
and there was domestic work
there was factory work uh
and there was just young people working
with people mowing yards and did those
kinds of things
and so uh for us black life
in bogalusa as a child didn't seem
bad and we knew
that there was a really a distant
relationship between black and white
and we were one of the families that had
a car sometimes if we
uh we're in a car and white kids would
go we go
yeah you know i mean this was those
kinds of things
i mean this was part of you know and if
they came into our neighborhood straight
before they were in for
a whipping and we knew there were
certain areas that were for whites
and there were white that if we got over
there that we we could be in trouble
uh so in terms of looking at black life
i think we had a why
or we learned to swim you know we didn't
have to swim in the creek
we had activities we had a school system
now
with the school system for example we
oftentimes got
the books from the white school we got
second hand books
uh and sometimes because white kids know
that
their books are going when they got
older they were going to go to the black
school they called me a
or something you see that in a book in a
textbook
uh sometimes we didn't have everybody
didn't get a book in class
we had to share books but we had
good teachers and we had teachers who
took exceptional pride
and making sure that we learned and uh
when things didn't go well
you had a problem and that was the time
when in black life when
every teacher had to visit basically uh
those
each child's parent to tell him what he
was doing in school what he wanted and
it had happened more than one time now
for us
black life was that we were poor
but one of the things that my mother
used to do was that my mother used to
uh my mother could bake and so she would
make cookies
for all of us in our classes and if you
were in a his kit class you were
guaranteed to get
cookies three times a year
around christmas uh for easter
and some other time and she her oatmeal
cookies were just
oh and even today uh my mother makes
oatmeal cookies and send it to uh my
her grandchildren and her
great-grandchildren that's a funny story
about
about the oatmeal cookies uh right now
that some people
one of my brothers was to give to my
other brother and somehow
his family got him and my other brother
didn't
like breaking down but i
and so we became to a degree black life
for us
had some special privileges though we
were poor and we didn't always
understand what
poor was and what poor meant because
there were families all around us some
families had more
kids than we did and some families i had
more than that family
but we all 88 out of each other's kids
we all eat beans
we all ate rice you know those kind of
things so while black life was certainly
segregated for us
as children well we thought we had it
going on
and then to a degree we uh we those of
us and we went off to college or we went
to uh we joined service and
life up until maybe i got into 11th
grade
things tend to be pretty good let me say
it was
um when
we were growing up
it was understood that if you saw a sign
that said white and color
it was understood that you didn't go
and drink from the water fountain that
had white
it was just uncertain things were just
understood
now if you look really deep in that to
know
how all of that build up that we
understood that
that's the same way you can look deep
into
my dad and to know
that whatever the problem was
we had that feeling as strong as we had
it about
race and uh injustice
we had that feeling that daddy was going
to take care of it
and that's the only way i can explain it
like that
sometimes in high school or 11th grade
10 or whatever
i was queen of the school i was at all
black school
i was queen of the school and
i think all the queens of the school
get an invitation uh from rex
down in new orleans for the mardi gras
ball
and i got that invitation and
i was oh i just
knew that i would be going to the wrecks
we had uh i didn't know anything i mean
i didn't know
i just said oh because your queen like
everybody else you get to go to rex
uh talk with one of the teachers from
new orleans and she said
no i don't think so uh so
we waited for daddy to come home and we
showed it to
the look in his eyes he knew it was a
mistake
and he knew what was going to happen to
me if i tried to go
a black queen tried to go to
rex during that time and
i remember that um
so a lot of people say go you have the
invitation just go
go to it and i think it was more
trying to think about protecting me what
would happen
and i was finally advised
to make a call and let them know that i
was black
and and oh i called to tell them how
many people will be coming
and oh by the way i'm black and
it didn't take long that they called and
said that was a mistake
um i changed that look in my father's
eye
when 35 40 years later
uh i got an invitation from rex
to come to um the rex uh
um ball
and it gave me so much pleasure
to be able to present that to my dad to
show him
that everything that he had done
and so many other people in bogalusa for
me
that it took that long and once again
i'm emotional you know
i'm trying to hold up here but it took
that long
for it to happen and that meant a lot to
me and it meant a lot
to see the the expression of my father's
face
uh and i went to that ball
think it was a one other black person
there
that was my husband and uh but we went
and i just want to share this with you
you know sometime
when you listen to people talk and even
your family they say things and it makes
you remember something
when uh charles was given his
perspective about
the uh the difference between black and
white back
back uh back in the 50s uh early 60s
you made me think about something that
me and my mom did just the other day
when we were growing up i guess we were
protected so well from a lot of things
so we had to have a happy audience i
know i had a happy childhood
and uh one of the things that happened
the other day me and mom was riding in
the car
when we was younger we went to the
neighborhoods
on this side of town outside of town and
we'll go what we call crosstalk to pop a
quarter
because that's what my grandmother had
on the stage
but i never went to areas like like
pleasant hill
i never even really knew they exist and
then and i
i bring this up because the other day
maybe last week
me and mom was riding in the car and i
said told mom he's over the pleasant ear
because i've never been on the street
before but that was a whole different
era to
us i never knew anything that they never
even existed
because until i became a man even during
the civil rights movement i still
was was unaware but a present here other
than the fact that
my grandmother or maybe well somebody
worked for
for people over there mommy used to work
because
our great aunt who lived to be 106
who was just the sweetest person you
could ever imagine
but you know when you were talking about
that i was thinking about uh
bogalusa and poplar quarters and when we
grew up there was another section of
bogalusa we lived on the south side
here and then there was the north side
we take our poplar quarters
and basically those two black
communities were separate
until high school
that we didn't have anything to do with
people on uh on the north side the black
kids over there
they had their own elementary school
they had their own junior high school
i don't know if there ever was a i mean
a high school in popular quarters
no okay yeah
so at that point you merged so all the
children
we didn't know anybody pretty much and
that was almost like seven times
you just didn't go to poplar quarters
you know
one and also i think and they probably
thought the same thing but we thought we
lived on the better side of town because
we were
on the south side and i'm sure that
those who grew up in popular quarters
stuff they
lived on the better side of town uh
and that so there was even in black life
there were two separate communities
now of course on both of those sides
there were different neighborhoods
in there but that's just an interesting
piece i was thinking about that black
life and
and and they we had the movie theaters
and all that sort of stuff
and they would have to come over and
even if you went to the movies
you know uh blacks from the south set
in sections and i guess i don't really
remember but i'm sure that
the kids from proper quarters sat
together and there weren't any physical
fights that said they might be
competition every once in a while but
that was just part of black lives that
black life was separate to a degree
because i was growing up now when we got
to high school we started to
come together and be one
miss hicks i wonder
how you thought your way through with
your husband the whole question of
taking that big big step forward come
64 65 and really
becoming playing the roles taking taking
up the roles that your husband took up
in that time
well after we got involved in the
in the movement thanks to barbara and
some of her friends
they they emptied the schools because
two little black girls went and said at
the woodwork counter
when they signed that that beer
and they thought that they could go and
and sit there and eat
they put them out they wouldn't serve
them and
that night the klansmen formed
and when the whole columbia road i don't
know if you think
it was just covered with big white
brawly men and uh
it was just something and then
after a couple of days they decided they
was going to come down
you know the
uh vocals supposedly decided to get core
in here and core
uh came in
my husband uh gail jenkins
fletcher anderson i think it was about
seven or eight men and gail
went down and they talked to court and
they got caught to come in
when corey came in they started telling
us about
how things would be how people
uh would try to hurt us if we sit at
those counters
we had to we had to test those
accommodations
and they would tell you not all the
coffee or anything
hot they showed the children how they
would knock them down
they showed the children how to get in a
ball hold their head and just let them
hit their backs
uh they did a a beautiful job of of
preparing us and uh
after all this happened they did uh
uh barbara and some of her classmates
decided uh they wanted to march
and uh we as adults you know
knew the dangers so we kind of stepped
back
they went to the school they pulled
every child out of the high school
they went to the uh junior high
elementary
elementary they put all those children
out
and when we looked around they had a
march
of their own coming down columbia road
and uh even even bob
and az couldn't stop him they was just
tired of being pushed around
and not having the opportunities other
people had
so that's how we really got involved in
the movement
after the day of testing
uh moments it is what
what we uh students
and the passing of the of the
civil rights uh act what we
and what those two black girls
understood
and what we could not understand is that
it was the law it was the law
so if it was the law why did we
have to wait for like daddy and
naisi and the leaders to tell us are we
gonna you know manipulate this
with uh this day and that day and then
we'll have people
coming with the training it was like no
it's
the law we're not going to listen let's
go
and so we went and we tried to bring
everybody with us but
we soon understood that um
it was the law but there were certain
things that you have to do you have to
plan and we we just thought we could do
which which really we should have been
able to uh
um there shouldn't have been any
planning or whatever
we should have been able to go and get
whatever we want
because it was the law and that's what
we kept telling
that nazi it's the law we can go when we
want to they already passed it
and that's how that's how we thought
i've read in the
published accounts about the that will
work set in that that those two
girls just sort of went and did it yeah
yeah is that how you did we thought
yeah but they would never release mama
oh okay they would never release the
clans
that's why they that's why you had so
many clans on columbia road
because they were uh they were
organizing
because they were trying to go out and
find out exactly who those girls were
and of course uh no they weren't gonna
intimidate it that was gonna be over
uh the probably parents uh also
and uh they
we were able to get them out of town and
that was that was the end of that
um until it was over i'm sorry could you
call out their names now do you think
would be appropriate
no no okay sometimes they say
uh about the south uh
that um
you remember and you don't forgive
and so i think if they knew who those
girls were you know
even now their families
and their lives there will be some
reaction
racism has has not died in a south part
in america
it's still alive and well yeah well
you're making me think obviously that
one thing that distinguished bogalusa in
its
extreme characters it was not uncommon
in
many many many places but its extreme
character was the nature of the local
police in their
close relationship with the clan
to any kind of racial social change so
i'm wondering if you happen to remember
anything that would
kind of paint a picture of the police
authorities in town back in those days
and what you're up against
you know uh after the after we did that
one day of testing we went through all
the legal things the mail
and all that stuff and they were
supposed to give us protection and they
didn't the children just
it was just something but anyway it was
over
and we all met at the labor union hall
and the policeman came in okay
okay it's over y'all can go home
the co-workers
had uh two white co-workers
beer yates and steve miller
steve miller was my baby
they came bob took them took them home
with us and uh
bob and and uh
leah yes was gonna have a drink they you
know
and eat and have a drink and relax
policemen came down to the house
want us to put them out put them
out there escort them out of town
and
that mother instinct came out and me
steve was young
i said this is some mother's
child and they're going to do them just
like they did those kids in uh
philadelphia they're not
they're not going to put them i said
don't let them take he told them said
this
is my home and these are my guests
and they're not leaving until they get
ready
they are my guests and i'm not putting
them out because of you
but you see that mother instinct
and me got bob in trouble
he uh had to stand up and then
after that bob said we've gone too far
to back
to turn around he started filing suits
i'm sure
uh dick silva told you all the different
suits he found
and then everybody wants to know why did
bob do it bob had five children
and why why why did he take that on
on up on himself but we had good lawyers
and they they back backed us up
and uh about five thousand he didn't
lose his job
but uh he had to stand up and he had to
take
a lot of abuse men had to carry him to
work
to keep the classman from doing anything
you know they say you kill the head you
you got the group they took him to work
they picked him up they brought him back
everywhere he go he had to have someone
with him
to protect him so really i was the one
with this mother instinct that really
got him in trouble
because if he could very well let them
take them
and i don't know what they would have
done to him we
talked to be a yates recently at the
bypass
and bill said that bob save his life
save his life i think that
one of the good examples of police
protection
and rogalusa was you can look at films
and whenever we march they allow
the hecklers to throw things at us
to spit on us i mean not only was a
verbal attack
but there was a physical attack and it
was not one time
uh it was a continuous attack uh on on
black
on the marches for black and white as a
matter of fact
if there were white watches in the march
they became more
vulnerable they were after them more
than they were after the blacks
but their example of police protection
was that
they did nothing you know they just
stood there and watched
us be assaulted of the attack uh
it got so bad until the bogalusa voters
league
filed suit and went into court and there
was a court order they had to order the
police and the judge threatened to not
have them
locked up if they did not protect us
so that's the extreme in terms of how
the bogalusa police were at that time in
many
cities and many places where you were
being attacked
you saw the police doing this keeping
the crowd back but you saw the police in
boca let's
step back so you they could they could
make their way through
i think that's an example and can be
documented by simply looking at some of
the films
uh on the many marches and there were
many marches
uh on a regular basis in bogalusa and
that pattern did not change
and so we had the bogalusa bola league
had to go into court
to get an injunction uh to force
the police department to do what they
were supposed to do
under the constitution of the united
states and
one of the things uh what my mom was
referring to
on the day of the testing and when the
chief of police came to the house
and tried to get the civil rights
workers out when he came to the house
and asked that we um that you know mom
and dad
you know put the people out and uh
when bill yates asked uh uh
miss hicks can i stay in your house
jackie so can i stay in your house
and she said yes you're a guest and
daddy said these are guests in my house
and i would not put a guest out well of
course
the chief of police was very upset the
daddy spoke with him
and wouldn't do that what he was asking
him to do
but daddy asks will you protect my
family
and the chief of police said he had 27
000 people in bogalusa
and that uh he didn't have time
that he liked and he didn't have time to
play nursemaid or babysit
people that he didn't like and that it
was a mob
that was coming down and that they were
going to take
uh bill and steve stephen bill
and um and the family
so when that happened um
mama was trying to get the children out
uh
steve miller went to call his mom
it's like it's like i see everything
happening all over again
uh he went to call his mom
to tell his mom what was gonna
what was getting ready to happen to him
um mama talked to him and said
that they were going to let him stay in
the house and do everything to protect
him
bill gates got on the phone and started
calling
new orleans the headquarters fbi
whoever he could think of i had a list
that we normally keep on the wall i took
the list and i went
next door to my great-aunt house and we
saw it making calls
that they were going to come and burn
our house down and kill us
and uh come with your gun and come and
help
so they started coming and also
they start calling other people to come
so after we had called everybody on that
list we came
back over to the house by that time
mama had called mama called
a friend and asked her
to come and pick us up the children up
to get us out of the house now she would
stay there with daddy she wasn't gonna
leave daddy
but she wanted us to get out of the
house
so they came through the back and uh
and the husband and the wife the husband
went
in brought some guns and
we mama got closed for us and we got in
the car
but we had to get on the floor of the
car
because
the police was still coming around
and she didn't want us to he didn't want
anybody to know where we were gone
so they slipped us out with us laying on
the back of the floor
and uh said no you couldn't uh
we couldn't call because the way that
the
the telephone systems were they would
find out where we were
so
we rolled all the way down on the floor
until we got there
and uh we never knew what happened at
that time
oh what happened to mom and daddy
uh we just didn't know we couldn't call
uh that's the way it was
that's how the police were
well you know the uh police part of
police boards were
klansmen and uh
one young man had gotten arrested
because they
they would just arrest you beat you up
and arrest you for anything
and while he was in jail the klansmen
came in
and he was so afraid and when he looked
down
he saw the police uniform from under the
clansmen
robe and uh
as i said we had to test every facility
we test the the park
i'd lived in volusia all my life i
hadn't hadn't
ever been in that cassidy park over
there
and while we were over there
the police can allow the whites to come
in and jump us
and now one old man had a gun they took
his gun
from him and they took his billy
diabetic club and
put him between his leg and jugged him
up the man was
oh he had to be what 68 seven or old man
and the policeman had a dog
and they allowed their dog to buy
river we couldn't get any
medical help here in bogalusa we had to
carry him all the way to
to new orleans we came to a va hospital
in new orleans that's how
how we got here and uh
they we had uh
uh the jenkins grandmother that
i'm sure y'all uh will uh talk to
she was very very fair and
they they started beating her because
they thought she was white
and bob went over and uh bowed them all
further
and uh she lost the keys to her car
and he uh pushed her car out of the park
but they they allowed those people to
come down and
and jump us and uh
that's one time when when uh when
they allowed that dog to bite gregor on
his leg
bob stood up and told that man
you have let that dog fight my boy
he said i am going to kill you
because you let him attack my boy
that policeman got his little gun and
his thing he left that part
i was furious because you know
to let to allow a dog and greg was
very small in stature very small
and he allowed it allowed that big
police dog to
bite that child on the leg
it was just horrible we we slept in our
clothes
we didn't we didn't take our clothes
off and i you it was because the clans
one were
all around until the men in bogalusa
decide to do something about
it and that's where your deacons come in
those
uh we bernadine
why where y'all was supposed to go over
to him
today her father was a very old man
and uh but he was wise when
when those uh girls sat at that
at that counter he said then we're going
to have trouble here in vogue
but this father talked about
every they made out a list and people
like different people had that list
taped on that refrigerator
whenever problem started somebody was
supposed to start going down that list
and uh this was from the wisdom of our
birth train wife
he knew he was gonna have trouble and he
knew what we was gonna have to do to get
help he knew the policemen weren't gonna
protect us but when when they
saw that all those men were coming in
down to our house with those guns
then they knew that
they were about to have trouble so what
the policemen did
they stopped them anybody coming down
that way
they stopped them they wouldn't let them
come down that way
but living in bogalusa the men the back
ways
and they came through the back and came
through other people's yards
and got to our house that way
we had people on top of the roof we had
people in the trees
and we we had our own protection
and though those men stood up they they
protected us
it just protected us you were saying
that this was the first time a group of
black men
responded this way you know
i guess you don't know too much about
black men
usually black men will let
white people just do them any kind of
way and they just scratch their head and
say yes sir
but these men decided enough was enough
we were just tired of being pushed
pushed around
and uh we decided to fight
and my husband really believed in the
law he
going to the big courts not not the
people here
he followed suit uh hicks versus class
claxton
uh police buglers police department
he filed and uh
he began he his word was we'll go across
the lake
because that's where our lawyers were
and those lawyers fought and they filed
suits and we we stayed at the
at the court so much down there
every time you look up we were headed to
those courts down there
and the judge even questioned uh gregory
because
once they integrated the school it was
fights over there
those those two are having problems
yeah i'm sorry
okay we're back see the children weren't
like us
we we always hesitate and step back
but those children had uh
backup they had their parents and uh
when we uh got to court at one time
george he be
christian gregory and he asked gregory
uh
how old he was what was his name and all
this
and asked him whether he go to school he
went to school at bogalusa high school
and uh how many blacks was there gregory
wasn't that many first year was i think
it was
two or three and then we went to
i went to second year four okay and the
second year
um i think it was me and theresa that
then went
their second year so i wouldn't have it
wouldn't have ever been
maybe six or seven in total uh
and maybe a year after that i seen you i
think this went up
to ask me going to princess
well anyway he questioned gregory he
said and greg told him his name
and where he went to school and
uh he said uh so you're the leader of
the group over
there han gregory and grace say
hi maggie pardon he said you're the
leader of the group over there huh
he said oh no so i'm a student at vogue
high
and and tv didn't know what to say about
it
he said no sir i'm a student
but the the children had to fight and at
one time they wanted to make
the black children stay up under the
step
and some of the stuff we didn't even
know about we were thinking the children
going to school
and they got the children in the office
and up under the steps and we didn't
even know about all this stuff
until gregory came home one day and he
mentioned that
they want them to stay under the steps
and he said i wouldn't stay on the steps
i hadn't done anything wrong
he said mom if i if i go under the steps
if i stay on the steps now i'll be on
the steps for the rest of my life
we're not staying under the steps and
it was just good that the children were
smart enough to know their rights you
know
to do something about it they they were
really
smarter than we were because we had
taken this stuff all our lives and
and just waited until our back really
got pushed up against the wall before we
started doing anything about it
but uh there's somebody else
you know greg you want to talk about the
cassidy park episode or maybe
but the only thing i i really remember
about cassidy park i'm probably trying
to hold on to pop
i was when i was young and wherever you
go i was father
and i was unaware of a lot of dogs and
so forth
now that uh not that i had any
intentions of
doing anything i just probably felt safe
being with my dad wherever he went
and i never saw the dog i never saw him
coming
but it was just just one of those one of
those things i was just brought just
with that
have you ever been chased by a dog and
and almost got bitten
do you know how you felt but just
imagine how
a small child that
uh a police dog bit him
on the lake so you can imagine the fear
that was in that
that child you know the
cassidy park what was the cassidy park
cassidy park was
the public park for bogalusa
and it was a segregated park and blacks
were not allowed to attend
but in the lawsuit one of the one of the
suits
that daddy found allow
uh people to go to cassidy park
and one of the things that they had to
do because the police was under an order
to protect
uh the wherever we were gonna go
and so daddy made a call and said look
uh
uh the children are gonna go over to
cassidy park
and play since it was now legal to do
that
at that court injunction and all that so
the police then made a call
to a group of to the clan or whoever
and apparently and there were not a lot
of adults
with those children maybe 20 18 20
children they were on the slides and
that sort of stuff so the police made a
call
and explained what was going to happen
so by the time they got there
10 or 15 minutes after they got there uh
these clan men are the these the white
men
came down and started attacking the
children
and then the police came in and so the
police then
started to uh rounding up the blacks
they put the dogs on the around their
backs they were not attacking the whites
whether while the whites were
attacking the blacks and so in that
process
uh greg got bit and then of course as
you you've heard the rest of the story
but that's what cassidy park was and
cassidy park was the park that we had
never been allowed to go to
uh and was named after the rich family
the cassidy
which my grandmother worked for
uh who the part was named for my
grandmother
had worked for father cassidy
tell us about you mark in your in the
march to tell something about you in the
march
how your dad didn't want you to
yeah well when the march started out
from
boulder well of course i was young they
didn't want me to go
and which march is there something this
is a march from baton rouge
from bogalusa
so one morning one morning
they got they were getting the food
together
so me got stuck in the car got nick
jumped in the car
because they had prepared sandwiches for
to meet him for lunch
so i got in the back of the car and i'm
just riding along and
i'm like i'm gonna get in this march
they're not gonna leave me behind this
time
so we got almost to covington around
wallheim or somewhere
up in in that area and that's where they
were gonna break for lunch under this
big
like oak tree so i get
out the car having them bring the food
and everything
so i go up to par and say i want to
march
no uk march is too bad but it really
wasn't
bad at that point because we were just
getting ready to come into covington and
they had
covered him was like the ally to us they
they were
ready for us to come through there i
think
so i talked them into it they let me
march
so that night when we got into covington
they did the covered wagon thing with
the cars and
everybody got in the middle and slept
on but they brought the kids back they
brought the kids back home
and you know let them sleep at home and
then
in the morning we get back up and go
bring the food and meet the
meet the march so we marched from
covington i think we did from coming to
the
hammond in a day and when we got to
hammond
it was really bad that night in the
hammock because they were
they were waiting for us and we got it
uh they didn't want us to use the
school uh
gibson was the principal at the time uh
the black
principal there at the time but uh
the whites didn't want them to use us to
use the school to stay overnight
because they knew up the road satsuma
and own up the road where it was going
to be more
right denim springs and and all these
areas
where it was going to be more trouble so
we got that at night and
people were riding and circling and you
know they say okay we got to get all
these kids out here again
so they sneaked us out again so the next
morning
everybody gets up thinking they're going
back and they say no
i know so me and another young
lady riri
we always wanted to be on the front and
we
they had these state police
that were on horses
and you know they would kind of let that
horse lag
back so it was a z paul
and then it was me then riri we were on
the front
and granny kept cutting come on no y'all
come to the back
it's not safe on the front that's
anything happen that's where it's going
to all
happen on the front because they were
you know targeting
azn and paul so
we didn't pay that no mind we you know
we just walking and holding
in the hands singing and
we i guess we started walking too fast
so we got up close to that horse
and easy came and grabbed me and said
come back here boy you get too close to
that horse
that horse is gonna kick you and knock
you out and he said that
cop not gonna let i'm not gonna feel
anything he's gonna keep on going
so we we we slowed up a little bit and
before you know it
we back up there again and then bringing
us back so
we were anxious and you know we were
just young we
we really didn't know the dangers of of
what was going on and how
dangerous it was and until they pulled
us out of the left
we walked a little bit out of hammer
when they started getting a little into
satsuma holden robert and all that
that's where they i never forget that
they had a church a red brick church and
i
when i go that back whale 190
they would not let the state police
take their horses over to that church
and get water they're trying to stop
that because we got
kind of slowed up there and they told
the police was driving over there to go
turn the faucet on and let the horse
drink the water and they waved them off
so get off the property
that's when they took us out then
because they knew it was getting ready
to get
to get back pretty bad yeah
they attacked the uh newsmen
over there in caster park took the
cameras from
them beat them up throw the cameras over
and look
it was rough it was rough
and the bad thing about it is
we were supposed to be marching no no
guns
we had no protection because we had
the guns in different cars
and what they did uh
and when we were parked in hammond
the policeman came on the ground the
troopers came on the ground they started
searching the cars father hold up
what are you doing researching these
cars for gone
bob said that's an illegal search don't
touch it
don't touch our car that's an illegal
search
so they backed off they was going to get
a permit to uh
to search the car in the meantime
put all the guns in our car got raw
to dry those cut those guns to get those
guns
out of there i was so
afraid because we had no communication
and rob was by himself with the car load
of guns
and i i i didn't know what was happening
to my child or if they had called him
because i heard one of the the troopers
say
just saw that car going out in here with
one of them driving it
said catch him and that was my child
so uh i just we just marched on but i
didn't know what happened to rob but so
happened rob had played
football and he knew some back rows
and that's why they didn't catch him
when i did got a chance to call
home my aunt the one who was telling
that was 106.
she said rob was home he hadn't made it
home
it would be interesting uh i i would
tell that
that adventure i mean not an eventual
what happened you remember that rock
when you drove yeah talk about it
oh well what happened i was driving so
fast that
i missed a turn and i had to go
farther and then come back if i wouldn't
have if i wouldn't have missed that term
they would have caught me but i throw
them off and i
and i came on in i made it came
another round that's the only reason why
that
they didn't
i'm interested in the
range of emotion and
feeling and
no doubt fear at times lots of that
pride lots of that to watch
family members parents grandparents take
these roles do these things
in conditions like that i'm just
wondering how
the emotional complexity of that
experience
well very emotional like i told you
about
when rob carried the guns we we just
didn't know what was going to happen to
him
so many times uh they would call
on this group of men that had farmed
because somebody was in trouble and they
needed
the group of men to go to their houses
to protect them sometime it was even in
mississippi or other places
and just to see uh those men go
out like that you never knew if they
were coming back
they they were putting out lives on the
line to protect other people
so that was always a fear
i was
that the kind of fear
that we experienced just went on
day after day after day um
even when dad and az
were negotiating with uh governor
mckibben
and he sent his airplane to pick him up
you never knew uh because she had seen
so many other things
happen or you heard about so many things
happening
so you never really knew um
what was going on you never knew when
someone called and said they were in
trouble
to come and help them i know one of the
times the deacon
was going out of town because some of
the civil rights workers were
trapped in the area hiding in the bond
area
and they had to go out of town to get
them and they were right
yeah they were white and they didn't
know
if it was a trap so they had to go
through
all of this to decide when to go when
not to go
and look like they always went and we
always went to try to help somebody
but in the meantime you know we would
stay on the
little radio we had a base at that time
um
in the breakfast room um
because when the telephone situation the
way the telephone situation was
uh when you try to call they would they
would cut the operators would cut the
phones off
um can you say why that was because
yeah because oh sure um
when we had to when we when daddy
reported
uh an activity that we were involved in
uh or we said something on the phone
then it was spread to
the clans or the whites uh who were
against us
and when we tried to call for help
they didn't want that to be also because
you have to understand
the operators at that time were related
to
uh they were not of course we had no
black operators so they were all
related and they were notified
of the plan that we had and i think uh
one time we did a setup for um
uh what daddy said they were gonna do
was uh
the deacons or so were talking and that
they were gonna
do a setup and they called someone to
report that they were gonna do
this this and this and uh whatever the
event was
and then of course all the whites came
and um
you know it didn't happen so that's when
we realized what was going
on and this that's when they um they got
the radios
uh plus you needed the radio so the
deacons could uh
communicate back and forth with what was
going on
um but it's not
what was hard the hardest
is that some people
were planted they had informers
that would come to our meetings and
we couldn't figure out how every time we
got ready to do something
then the clans would always be there
and uh so
you know i was young too you know but i
i didn't know those the details
that was going on there but i know in a
meeting
they stopped the meeting and they
surrounded the people
these were elderly black people
and they had taken all the notes and
they've written everything down
and uh so daddy and the deacons dealt
with that
you know i i don't know what they what
they did to the people
but they they dealt with that um
so we get to a point where
we have informers many
from the governor's office coming down
like they were fbi's or whatever
just inform us just feeding information
back
to the governor's office um so it never
stopped
and we had a part
where they put a hit out on my dad
um and mama you have to talk about that
well they they they were paying
some black they were supposed to kill
him
but it just so happened uh we found out
about it and as i said
he never went anywhere alone he always
had someone to
to protect him and at one time
uh six if i could interrupt for one
second do you remember
when in the sequence of events that
happened
and i i'm not you know too you know when
they
put that uh you remember what time it
was
uh when they had that man no i don't i
don't know i remember about i remember
but it was but in the neighborhood it
was so much
harassing that they have a movement and
everything
guys would be riding in black
neighborhoods disturbing them doing
doing things so that's why they they had
the organization and they would go out
and
and check out the situation because if
they have a march
that'll make them ride and do things
people burn crosses or whatever
so you know they really patrol
neighborhoods from this side of town
to the north side of town
and then you know they had dead uh
different men that had to have uh
somebody come pick them up from work at
certain times because they
there was a threat to their lives
at one time one of the klansmen pulled a
gun on
az put a gun to az's head
they was having trouble at one of the
schools that was being integrated and
bob and az was over there and one of the
men
stepped out and put a gun to az's
head and said they were gonna kill him
and bob ran to the back of the car got a
gun
and put to his head said
you might kill a-z but i'm gonna kill
you
at that time the policeman grabbed off
and took bob to jail they didn't nothing
to the man that
threatened az's die and uh
they wanted to charge him with attempted
murder
and all that and then i just
told the policeman you're arresting him
he don't have a scar on him and he
better not have a skull on him when we
get him back
we went over to the jail we could not
find bob
we couldn't find them anywhere they put
them in solidarity to keep anybody from
getting to
and then i also told them i'm facing go
call judge heavies and tell them that
y'all arrested him he hadn't done
anything and
they protected him at that time his mom
who was very old
and the camera was was and she got out
of the car and she walked very low in
stature
and uh they said uh
lady where are you going she said that's
my son they arrested
and i'm going to see that my son is all
right
and she marched in that that jail and
they let us see him he said
mom i'm okay you just go on back home
i'm okay
let's see once again that's that
mother's love
she marched right through all those
clansmen
and went in there to check on her son
she was born in 1900
you know i guess one of the things about
fear uh and i guess there was
two or three types of fear that existed
in our community and of course one fear
was
that something was going to happen to
you physically
i think another kind of fear was
just psychological and i think to a
degree
in stages that was more
challenging and emotionally draining
than any
than the physical fear certainly in a
march
i was cheerful when i watched it and i
didn't watch as much as my brothers and
sisters because i was in school
at southern and that's another piece
that we'll talk about
but uh there's always this fear that
they're gonna
uh you can get they're gonna run out and
hit you
and nobody likes pain and i even when i
was a little boy and had to get
as children when you got a whipping you
didn't want it because
it hurt and so pain hurts
but i think the psychological fear
of having to go emotionally through this
every day
and particularly for us as a family
to begin with was just an enormous
piece of stress that we never knew
when my dad went to work if he was going
to come back
and there was a point that they drove
him to to work every day
to the box factory but he had to walk
maybe
20 feet they could only take him so far
then he had to get out of the car
and walk to the mill now when he got
inside the mill
he was well protected because there were
black men there and they were going to
protect him
so the psychological fear of wondering
and we knew they wanted to kill them
they had built a coffin
at one point and put it on columbia road
saying that they were going to kill him
and he lies robert hicks and so the
psychological fear
of never knowing if this is the day
that is not going to come home
this is the day when he goes in but he
won't come out
whether i could get in and to have to
carry that
that mental stress and anguish as a
family
for years uh is
enormous kind of emotional stress
and i think that stress did not only
exist
uh that's what the i mean existed with
us because we were a family
and as a family we had always been a
family and sometimes
maybe we can talk a little bit about
what family life was like before the
moving and after the movie
but also uh the fear that
uh when mr y uh a ricky
uh anybody went someplace that was
involved in the movement
you didn't know if they were gonna make
it or when they got arrested
you know what was gonna happen to them
the fear that when they took those young
black girls into jail
whether or not they were going to molest
them whether or not they were going to
rape them
i mean all those kinds of psychological
fears and for those people who were
marching in things you never knew what
was going to happen and i think
emotionally that was that was a piece
of the movement that has played an
enormous toll
on so many people in the movie not only
in bogalusa but throughout the country
and it's a piece that really has never
been explored talked about
the psychological effects of the
movement uh
on individuals in it so i i think that
that was a piece of fear there was fear
of policemen
it was a fear of the pose of the the
clan
and the whites attacking you but there
was also the psychological fear
of what you went through every day or
just living in the movement
let me use that to to turn the
conversation
wrong um you that as a
moment to switch back over the question
the deacons because one response that
could help
and did help um
folks have a different feeling about
what might be possible was to
know that there was a system that could
provide some measure of protection and
defense and
and in bogalusa was a defense obviously
and um
we haven't we've talked a lot about the
roles that they play but not so much
about the deacons themselves and the
organization and
how you saw that group come together and
and
how you measure its significance well i
think
because of the defense a many lies were
saved
even though they never killed anyone
but they were there they they had
guns and uh
i mean you know when you go against a
gun
it could be you or it could be me so
this
uh by the grace of god they never had to
kill anybody they never had to
well the only person that got shot
was we were on a march
and a white nurse was in the car and
when the klansmen
was going in the car to pull her out
cursing and was pulling out
and a black guy shot him and that's the
only
time that anyone was shot
but uh those men uh
stood up whenever was in the trouble
they were there
and uh i i'm sure uh
fletcher told you martin luther king was
this non-violent man
that didn't believe in guns and when we
went to that marriage march
when king got ready to march
he looked around and said where are the
deacons
i'm sure i'll fletcher told you and uh
it was just that protection and
those you had some strong black
men that they they have had just taken
so much that they were ready to put
their lives up for protection
yeah that's that's what you just said
you know because when i heard those
stories that was my
couple of most amazing stories i ever
had heard
when fletcher told about how keane
wouldn't move without the deacon
and another story that he told that you
guys probably also
was that when meredith immigrated
ole miss they had problems
until the deacons yeah and did not have
a problem
from that very moment that they arrived
i never heard that story until
to uh to reflect on telling uh about the
money after my dad did not i never knew
that story
so much about the deacons that we knew
what they were doing
but with but we're not safe we're not
allowed was always told not to say
to don't expose these these these these
men
to uh to get their names out because of
fear what
what may happen to them in their family
life
they had um the movie uh
with uh forest whitaker and uh okay
oscar davis and uh
silverman yeah jonathan silverman
they on the uh they they talked about
the deacons
and asking why was it
that when they were in the process of
doing the
the movie that they tried to get
information about the deacons and why
was it they couldn't get any information
and why was it that the people in
bogalusa act as if they were ashamed
of what they had done and
we just smiled when we saw that
at that time i really wanted to write
them and tell them what it was
what the situation was but uh my father
was still living then
and um so i said
now that my father's not here
and i'm not gonna give all the names but
i can tell you
we could not
give information out because
the fbi when we gave information out
the fbi who we had many times
seen associating with the uh the police
officers
and the police officers were the one to
attack us
with the other whites and so when you
put that together
then you don't really want to share
information
because it endangers the deacon's lives
so no we would not tell you don't
discuss what happens with the deacon you
don't discuss
the sickness that they have though it's
just
those things you just don't you just
don't discuss
and uh of course we are proud everybody
so many people uh that's living now
is because of the protection from the
deacons
and my dad always said uh
what kind of man uh
you know martin luther king was a good
man
he had a dream but my dad fought for the
dream
and it was his right to fight for the
dream
you have a constitutional right and
that's what daddy said
i have a right to bear arms and if i
am if i need to protect my family
especially when the police did not
protect us
then he had a right to do that the
deacons had a right to carry the gun
mckethen governor mckinnon came on
television
and said i know
that they have a right to carry those
guns i know that
but what i'm going to do i'm going to
take every gun away from them
that i can to disarm them
and it would take a period of time
before they can get their guns back
and that was his plan we have to go to
court
we have to go to court but at least i'll
get the guns out of the uh
black men in uh you know in bogalusa
um but no
we the deacons had the guns for
protection
and uh that was it when uh
the deputy sheriff uh o'neal moore and
creed rogers were killed
in uh the angie vanito area um
now understand that we didn't have any
black
police officers or sheriffs at all
and that was one of the things that they
asked for daddy and
uh i said daddy i mean daddy the
bogalusa voters lead
that's one of the things that the
lawyers wrote up and presented to the
mayor
presented to the governor uh we wanted
to have
black police officers and we got them
now what people don't know
is the deacons for a long period of time
because we know it was a setup they
protected
the police the definite sheriff
everything was going on fine everything
was okay
and then it happened um
and my daddy really felt bad about that
um
but that was going to happen that was
the setup anyway it was going to happen
when they called the wife may bella
and told her to get out of the house
that they were going to kill the family
it was the deacons all of the deacons
that went up there to protect the
the moore family and brought them back
into the home
uh may vellamore tells the story all the
time
so they save that life you see
articles all the time in the paper where
people
respond about the deacons that came
through bogalusa how the deacons saved
their lives
um so no it's just not a
you know just a group of black men were
going just carrying guns and shooting
whatever
no we were not the clans in attitudes
we had men to protect
the families and that's exactly what
happened so that was
uh you know that was the deacons that uh
that we saw and um
that we felt safe about about the man
to the death that cannot be replayed
um oftentimes when the civil rights
workers came in
and we were going back and forth to
court
um the deacons would go back and forth
with him to court
and um yeah in a federal court down in
new orleans
and uh they just wouldn't know they were
fine now they had so many leaks or so
they would find out what new i guess
they look at the lights and places so
and they discover you know this is this
is somebody new coming in
and so the clans would be behind them
right behind them
and um so we had uh we had deacons who
knew the route
just as rob did you know different ways
to go
and to to uh try to protect the people
coming in
you had to bring them in you had to have
to meet them you had to bring them in
that's why they got the crossing of the
book the cross and border street
you know you have to protect the men
that's coming in
and the civil rights workers going out
that was a constant thing that we had to
do
when malcolm x
was assassinated
and that was a day
after my father's birthday my father was
born february the 20th
malcolm x was assassinated on the 21st
the deacons for defense the chaplain
both chapter in bogalusa was born
and we felt safe after that
one of the things that uh the vogue
supposed league and
that organization did was to have the
black white signs removed
at the federal building black white
at the courthouse where my husband
worked
crown zelda back black white service
stations
everywhere
and uh we put on
drives to get black people registered to
vote
i remember one old lady i think she was
related to ricky hill too
she went to the courthouse and she she
was very old like 90 years old or
something
and they have an elevator there and they
wouldn't let her go
wouldn't let her use the elevator to go
upstairs to register
and she said don't worry about it baby i
crawled up
she crawled up the stairs so that's
that's
you know that's the kind of strongness
that was developed
in in bogalusa we stopped
shopping here at bogalusa
so many stores from the main street
gone we we stopped shopping and
we go other places to shop
and uh every time they'd have a big
affairs
where they were uh the whites were up in
there having a big party
at one of the fabulous restaurants they
had
we got a group of people and go test it
and those people would leave so we ended
up we got that rest of that fabulous
restaurants closed so uh
anything that the league could do
to betterment the blacks we did it
we just worked on it we did it we
marched
every day every day we marched
we burned up a lot of police cars but we
marched every day
you know can i just ask one thing how
are folks doing
does anybody feel like they need a break
one more time
we we're used to this so many times when
the family
we just get together i don't know why we
never
uh we're gone and uh
uh what tape it yeah
we just talk about it and just talk
about it i remember
every time we would get with gail and we
were marching and
uh they wouldn't let a group of people
join the march
and uh one of the uh
policemen pulled a gun on the ladies
told us she couldn't join that
or he'd shoot her and she told him and
your mama miss you from supper tonight
so they can't remember that she said
your mama miss you from supper tonight
but uh you know once they were
determined to do things they didn't
they did it and uh the children
caught it in school they had to fight
they had to fight in school that was
all the time we just
go kept going down there and uh i went
in with uh the the
judge called us in one day
and uh the jury's
uh and dick brought us in
and uh the judge was talking to us and
he was telling them that he was going to
protect our children
and let them keep going to school and
and how he was gonna protect them
and i said uh wait a minute judge i'm
gonna
tell you something i said i've heard
about how you was gonna protect them but
our children go to school and they are
attacked every day
i say every time i telephone rain my
heart is in my mouth because my
my children are over there and you have
not protected them
you told us you was gonna protect them
but you haven't
protected them they're still getting
beat up over there
he said let me tell you something miss
hicks i told you i was going to protect
them
and i'm going to protect them he put a
fine on them that
if one child got attacked over there how
much the school was gonna have to pay
and we walked out of the chamber and
dick's over looked at me and he said
jackie
do you know you're not supposed to talk
to the judge
he said i'm the lawyer you're not
supposed to talk to the judge
he said but i want you to know you did a
hell of a job
i said those are my cheering dick that's
not the judge that you're
and and it was such a small amount of
them they they didn't have a chance over
there
and he was the one who told us to send
no children over there
and i felt like he had a right to do
something about it
you were talking about the deacons and
the influence that it had
and i think one of the things that the
deacons did when you look at them
uh and of course they didn't start in
bulgaria they started in jonesboro
uh and we were one of the first chapters
after that
uh but one of the things that the
deacons did the role that they played
was certainly
to protect the community and families
and i think for us as a family being a
mark family
uh we got super protection we never went
any place
24 7 without being escorted by the
deacons
so our whole world changed and we were
all protected
and i think when you look at the deacons
i often say there were two kinds of
deacons
there was a group with fletcher and
charles sims and that whole group
and but out of that came another group
of deacons which were
what i call the unofficial deacons and
that was the group of black men who
did not guard our house but uh we're in
a neighborhood
and they go to the neighborhood the man
came home from work
and that uh there were three black men
in that on that street
then uh one night mr smith got up the
street if somebody
came down there carter didn't recognize
he was there and they spent nights
laying in the front of their house on
the floor guarding
the next night mr broomfield guarded the
street
and so one of the interesting things
that the deacons did one of the roles
that they played
they created a self-empowerment
self-protection
not only as an organization but
as pride in the community black men
began to say you know i'm gonna take
this step
i'm going to be i'm going to do what the
deacons are doing you know
and the vegans had a role because there
were people who were in the movement
there were leaders
they needed to be protected and those
leaders were the leaders of the bogalusa
voters league
and the role that they were playing was
to fight the fight
to leave the marches to follow suits and
do all that
but we needed the deacons you know to
protect the leaders
and the families to mark families but
then it became a second group
that are in the community and that that
group
uh became an unofficial group of deacons
and that was all over bogalusa in terms
of blacks
organizing among themselves from popular
quarters
uh to bogalusa to wherever
you know you had that kind of thing that
happened because
the deacons got organized and that began
to
i'm sorry you may want to let mama talk
about
uh bloody wednesday in uh
in uh in bogalusa
on fourth street yeah yeah
uh a.z was in in the hospital
something happened they had arrested bob
pope
just stayed in jail so much but he'd
come out and he'd fight right on
the the a group of people decide they
would go
march at night
and they started the march and the
policeman surrounded they had no leader
there
they they surrounded them they started
feeding the people they call it bloody
wednesday
they beat every black person they could
they had buses they load them up on
buses and uh
people coming from work didn't even know
what was happening they
beat them and throw them in the bus to
people that were in the restaurants they
went pull them out and took them to jail
and uh they just had a whole
group of black people men and women
down there in jail and uh
this is this is what they call it the
the
bloody wednesday because they beat those
people up
they their leaders were were not with
them
they didn't have any anyone to really
protect them
but you were down there yeah but it
wasn't that much i
could do it they're trying to get you to
tell about when you and gail were in the
car
when they tried to get you to come out
oh yeah uh
the policeman uh when the policeman came
to the car
mary was there mary williams i'm sorry
and they came to the car
and they they uh snatched down the door
and uh said come on out of here and i
just picked my gun up on my lap and
pointed to him told him i wasn't moving
i was not moving so mayor and i stayed
in the car
then we locked the door and vert train
wire came and got his birth training and
maurice perkins came down and got
us and and carried us home but they
we must have been the only people that
didn't get put in jail down there
because i
refuse to took my pistol and pointed
right out of my side i'm not getting out
of this car
i was not getting out of that car and it
was sort of like a reaction
uh that a lot of these people who
decided to march
had not necessarily been involved in the
march as
such and 4th street was like
uh the center of entertainment for black
bogalusa
there must have been 24 different
bars and you know places there
little restaurants and things but that
was pooh halls that was black life
but a lot of the people who were down
there on that wednesday
when they heard that daddy had gotten
arrested and a couple of other people
got arrested
as my daddy says in the film he said you
know when when bogalusa folks get uh
black folks make up their mind to do
something you can't stop them
he has a famous he said that all the
time and so they decided they were gonna
march because daddy been arrested
and gail and uh people in the voters
league
so they decided we go this is gonna be
the people's march
and so mama nell went down and said wait
y'all can't do it that way you don't
have a permit you don't have this
and see we were on a court order it was
twofold whenever we did anything
we were to notify the police department
and it was like that but they decided
they were gonna do it anyway
and so they started this march and then
they call in all those police because
they were marching illegal
and they beat everybody they could lock
them up and if you happen to be getting
out for work at four o'clock
walking down the street they beat you
and threw you in the results of that
however
was that all those people who had not
been involved in the march got involved
in the march
i know you got a gecko just take a break
yeah we're rolling again okay we just
are back from a little break
i wanted to i wanted to ask y'all for
your perspective about the following
um there's a kind of a there's a kind of
a culmination
in in july of 65
when um after all that tension through
the spring and it gets to
july and i think az young says you know
we're on the verge of civil war
here it's tensions have kind of peaked
and uh and the federal government
intervenes in a certain kind of way john
doerr
comes from just department and some
suits are filed
on the moment and so people people think
about that moment
some people look at that moment and they
say one thing some people look at that
moment
and they say another and i'm wondering
about your perspective
about the transition across kind of that
moment in the summer of 65 and going on
from there because bloody wednesday's
after that for example
and lots of other things keep happening
and you know there's a lot of
but i'm wondering about how you feel
about
change you know what changed what didn't
change
could i tell you something about john
doe
john doe we were at a meeting
at a z young's house
and john doe's group of men that he had
in here had done nothing but what you
doing
looking at things writing it down
they stood up there and watched those uh
barbers
connect their hoes to a hot water tank
and and uh put it on those
young white civil rights workers that
was picketed
and all they did was they wrote it down
and a lot of things they saw they wrote
it down
so then john doe came in he had this big
meeting with us and he was so proud of
what his
man his men had done
and i was tired we had been working i
was tired
and then i just kind of sit up and i
told him
you and your men are not doing anything
we don't need you to write notes we can
write notes
if we gonna write notes and do nothing
with it
we don't need we have a problem with
some fbi agents too
maybe they're better but it's some of
them i don't care too much about because
they didn't help out either
and a lot of time they get that
information they sit on it
they they have enough information to do
things with and they don't do it
and john doe was one of those people and
then i just told him how i felt about
him and ac was very upset with me
because john doe was the big man
but he hadn't done anything and was it
wasn't any reason to sugarcoat him
well i guess
the way i kind of look at part of that
is
i don't see after 65
where justice was served
i don't see where they arrested anybody
i don't see where they put anybody in
jail
i don't see where they put restrictions
in terms of progress
in this whole struggle and that when you
begin to look at
65 to 2005
you know you still say that there are
uh educational problems in uh the
african-american community
uh there's still high employ
unemployment in educate
in the black community um there's still
problems uh getting uh jobs
uh there's still many of the problems
that we had in 60 uh in the early
60s are still here in different kinds of
ways
we have certainly a high prison
population
that is continuing we have drugs
in african-american communities and
african-americans don't have the
resources
to bring drugs into their communities in
the way that they're being brought
certainly that this has to do with a
bigger
picture and there's this whole issue
about
the war on poverty and the war on drugs
and how that was out and even the war in
vietnam and the change of
the contraband and drugs and all those
issues so you begin to wonder
though there has been progress in terms
of public accommodations and
and the issue really in the world when
the movement began for many
uh people in the movement was not about
public accommodation it was about jobs
and economic
fairness and i think it became an issue
that won the press
and part of some of the civil rights
major civil rights organization
that came out of a quaker movement
a philosophy of non-violence and and all
of that
and felt that part of this also be
public accommodations getting people to
accept you and perhaps with the idea
that if you accepted us
if we could eat with you you would
accept us and but then
eating in restaurants didn't get us any
jobs
you know and so those become crucial
questions
uh whether or not we have uh we're
better off
but now that we've integrated schools uh
is it's certainly up for debate uh and
the mechanism of selective
uh segregation uh de facto segregation
all these problems exist uh today
and certainly one of the things that and
i think when you start to look at
the civil rights movement
in small towns composed
as opposed to places like atlanta new
orleans birmingham
when those movements happen uh baton
rouge or wherever
you had a massive support system
especially we had more people you
usually you had a young
uh you had a young young people from
colleges that participated in
in that fight but in small towns
throughout the south
the movement was different the whole
fight was different
because number one you'd have the peace
people
you didn't have the resources and you
didn't have always the support
and so it was a whole different kind of
fight and
still today those problems
to a degree still exists in small towns
that the problem the advantages that you
have in a public school
in new orleans and the resources are
different from the schools in
bogalusa you know so we'll begin to look
at what progress has been made
certainly we made progress in terms of
public accommodation
and certain other minor places and
certainly
we have the right to vote and we vote in
northern helmus
but when you get down to the bread and
butter of it you know
we have not made as much progress as
people would like to believe
lead us to believe that we have uh and
so my take is that uh we have a long
ways to go
and that we made submit enormous
sacrifices
uh and it has not paid off
uh as king once said there's still a
check that is
cash yet to be cashed
it's hard to answer that one
um anybody else want to talk a little
bit about
what josh didn't tell you uh
he was at school at southern university
state school and he got out of school he
wanted a friend and came over to march
and a march with us
they expelled them from school
and uh bob had made
bob made a take that someone come over
and take this
not in the best uh condition now
but anyway uh bob had a beef with uh
john mccain anyway because he had put
his son out of school because he marched
into march
so uh the people that were in the high
places that could have helped us out
they didn't and then the few
white people who did try to stand up to
help us out
they retaliated against them so they
they just feel like most black people do
they kept their mouth shut
and sit down and didn't do anything
charles did you want to talk about that
well yeah uh and i don't know if that
uh is really you know in terms of your
question but
as an experience uh and i think one of
the
things about this family
is that each one of us and it'll be
interesting and i think you have some
notes about
uh different experiences that each one
of us had
and of course one of my experiences was
that i was expelled from southern
university
and one evening the dean of men
called me and some friends at southern
end
and said i need to talk to you all
you know we have some peace corps
volunteers on campus and you all have
been
interacting with them and we're
concerned this is the first time we've
had peace corps volunteers on campus
and we don't want and they were white
basically and
we don't want any problems and we have a
concern that we don't want to have
any problems and so we explained to the
dean that
we were being we just had formed a
friendship we would all eat
dinner together and sit out on the quad
and
some place and talk and share
experiences and stuff and they were from
all over the country
and uh he said well we're very concerned
about this and uh it
must have been six of us in that in that
meeting about six o'clock in the evening
so then he said uh the dean of men
said okay well that's what i wanted to
talk to you about
and then as we got ready you said mr
hicks i need you to stay
and so i had been i was active in
student government so i thought he
wanted to talk to me about something
with student government
he said mr hicks we we've identified you
as the main source of concern here
and that uh we've decided that
we need to expel you and i thought
i knew dean jones well so i said
sheridan jones right you smell me
he said i'm serious mistakes i say sure
steroids and i'm
i'm chuck hicks and he said i'm not
playing
he said i want you pack yourself
and get off this campus immediately uh
and i think that that perhaps was the
most everything
devastating thing that ever happened to
me i'm sure it was at that time
number one was that i was the first
generation
in my family to go to college i remember
when you
they would come to high schools and get
to take the test
for the army i remember we were in the
dining room and the man the recruiting
officer told me
i said i don't need to take that because
i'm going to college
and so with this concept of mine of
going to college and
being being in college and finishing for
college was
i mean that was what i was supposed to
do that's what i planned
i knew from there or not since i was in
ninth grade that i was going to college
and so all of a sudden to be told hey
you're out
and i want you out not tomorrow but now
and there was no hearing no
judicial process we had a student court
do a hound thing
nothing i just had to get off that
campus it reminded me when i think back
to when
uh the students marched on southern
university from southern university
marched in the capital and after they
did that
the president called them in and he said
i want you to take
every piece of paper every pencil every
pen i want everybody to be off this
campus in
24 hours and anything that you leave on
this campus will be destroyed
and we will readmit you one by one i
mean that
that was the same kind of thing on it
was an individual case
and i remember that i
called home and i said
i'm being kicked out of school and i
didn't do anything
and i oftentimes reflect back on it and
i said you know
i think that if suicide had entered
i probably would have taken seriously of
committing it
uh southern is located on the banks of
the mississippi
and that's a picture of me in the
yearbook where i walked out on one of
those
long things that washington i i
probably reflecting back uh that would
be i mean
i just felt that i was being put in a
position where
i was the beginning of hope i was the
new generation i was a new beginning for
my family
i was the first one to go to college and
here i was
that being taken and that was absolutely
devastating
uh 63
three four about 65 but i think it was
66 66
63 yeah i graduated 63 and that was
i was a junior i think a sophomore
something around that time
but one of the things that
i didn't know was that because of the
conflict happening between
the bogo league bogalusa voters league
between my dad and the governor
and they had had a meeting with the
governor
and the governor uh had wanted a cooling
off period
and they refused and they refused
to have a cooling off period because the
governor had not met the demands
of the bogalusa voters league so when
they flew them back from baton rouge
he had a press conference and announced
that the bogalusa voter league
had agreed to a press conference and my
dad said when they got back it was a z
uh gail jenkins i think rit
granddaddy okay uh he said that there
were 250 black people in the union hall
mata tale at them
and it took them an hour to convince
them people that they had not sold them
out
and you know saying what is this you
know we've been beat we've been spit on
we've been all this and y'all go off and
we ain't got nothing and he kept saying
so they called a press conference
and in turn that the governor is
mistaken the roycot will continue
and at that point the governor was
against the wall and of course he began
a personal attack on the hicks family uh
and i became a victim now my sister
barbara was at dillard
and they and they tried no no no no
no this is that they tried to find a way
to expel her
but she was at a private school and
southern was a state school
and because uh the good the state
southern university was on the opposite
of the governor he
ordered that i'd be expelled
and so that was just uh the most
devastating thing that
that uh that i went through uh in terms
of
a personal experience uh no one can
remove it the one thing when charles
called and told us that he had been
expelled
and he was in tears and i said uh
charles don't worry about it
you got a mom and a dad who loves you
and you will go to school you don't have
to go there
and uh he said but i didn't do anything
we knew he hadn't done anything we knew
exactly what happened
uh mckinson was getting at bar because
bob and they z would not call that
boycott off
and the people here in bogalusa was down
his back
so uh that's what happened
when um i just want to go back a little
bit
um when the civil rights movement
started
and uh the co-workers
all the students from california
berkeley all over
came in and
the first one stayed at our house and
then
thereafter uh we had a lot of civil
rights workers to stay at our house
then it expanded through the community
and um but that change
one of the things that happened and with
all the threats from the clans
one of the things that happened is that
we could no longer sleep in our beds
because you had my room was given to
to my sister my room was given to
the civil rights workers there
in the front part of the house the
living room
in the dining room area was the deacons
and all of their guns
um and in the the boys room
um i really don't know how we did that
we just
that's where we were in that that area
so we changed from
never sleeping in pajamas
anymore uh taking baths
early because all the lights had to be
out
at a certain time so you know so they
didn't have
lights so they can see what was going on
in the home
uh we all knew and we were aware
of the deacons on the top of the roof
just all over
deacons were all over and when we walked
we had to be careful because you had to
walk past
deacons and you had to walk past gone
so that went on it seemed like
a long time when i left and went out
to college uh there were many problems
um of course
you're in college you're trying to
concentrate
you hear the news you get a telephone
call everything
is happening in uh bogalusa and
you just you just could not put yourself
into
what you were there for uh it was very
hard
in addition to that you were trying to
do your own thing
the things that was that were happening
there you tried to
get people involved with the movements
you would go out for
voters registration the help of
the different organizations uh
wrap brown came in he spoke well
not wraparound anymore but he spoke
just a lot of things that just that was
constantly
going on and it went on and went on
until i think either
the the graduation itself
or right before the the church sermon
whatever it was
uh that was the incident in bogalusa my
mom couldn't come
she couldn't come to the graduation of
the
whatever was going on the baccalaureate
sunday thing or whatever
something had happened somebody fought
in the house somebody had done something
to someone so they they couldn't make it
so all that
was affecting you um
so once i was uh
i served as the first black director of
nursing
for the city of new orleans department
of health
and they had someone to come to the
office
and he wanted to do a book
and he wanted to interview me
and it was as if i had never
been in the civil rights movement i had
successfully taken everything
and took it out of my mind completely
and he was asking me about people
just major things that happened i just
don't remember
i just don't remember so he finally
closed this little paper
you know and then he left or so um
but over the years because
my father talks civil rights and human
rights
all the time and so a little bit with
support
it just start coming back and coming
back
but that's the kind of psychological
effect
that it had it was so bad and you
worried
so much about
daddy mama being hurt or killed
or whatever until you try to put it out
of your mind
and
that's not good that wasn't good
my baby sister who's dead now
um she wrote a book hidden shadows
and i'm going to share that with you
um she explains how
her whole life and i think she was like
13.
she explains how her whole life how she
missed when civil rights started
in our in our town how
her mom and dad were taken away from her
and so she missed all of her mom and dad
per se
she didn't have them there because
when you walked in the house somebody
was there all bloody
uh you had someone like taking
a deposition or so on the floor writing
getting the story
you had mom and dad always involved
in something um
there was no more life um
we could not we didn't have the friends
that we had before
because uh they were afraid and
so the association was different we had
problems in school
because the teachers many of the
teachers did not participate
in the movement and uh
they would talk about mom and dad
why they started all this mess and so
that would go
on and on and we got all of this
so you try to
you try to deal with it
in a way that you could go on with your
life
but uh as i was telling someone not too
long ago
uh the civil rights movement
and the experience that i went through
with hurricane katrina in new orleans
those experience will always affect you
some kind of way and
by learning from my mom and dad
it's hard it's hard not to see
uh prejudice or a bias situation
um went through a situation
with my mom and uh just last week
and i said i don't want to go over the
whole situation
but i said to mama mommy you know what
daddy would have said
if it sounds like racism
if you look and you see that it's racism
and you hear racism he said it is racism
and that's what i saw three days
four days ago discrimination
on age uh gender
and race 82 year old
black female just just was discriminated
against
and uh so i think my father because
my father has given something even
though we went through everything we
went through
i learned so much from him and he's
given us so much
until we can
we cannot rest until injustice
is really uh until we have justice for
everybody until freedom
is here until you have respect for
82 year old black female uh
here in bogalusa it's right there for
you
and you have to stand up and you have to
do what you have to do
and as we like to say is hicks
you know the bob hicks came out of us
and so you stand up
and you do what you have to do um
so the effect on the entire family i
don't know how
my other siblings feel
but um it's it's
the civil rights movement
and the injustice that we went through
as a family
will uh remain with us
forever
i listened to something that barbara was
saying
and kind of surprised some of the things
she said because
i got some similar
beliefs in some of the things she said
i was young i had a happy childhood
probably up until the time of the civil
rights
movement started we were just totally
involved as a
as a family we did everything we we
believed in the things we do
and was was the good and the right thing
to do
but i think the effect that it had on me
from seeing government captain in the
house and
and uh the way he he would uh
try to manipulate the uh the black
leaders and seeing all the things in my
young life
he gave me a nasty taste for politics
and anything
i have never been since his since i left
left home been involved in anything
happening with politics it did not
sit nice with me i i i just i don't do
it
all right uh one of the things i always
remember
what mother sister said well she see
she believed that you know
people in this country would leave the
kids alone
they would screen it out you know you
stop
you know you teach them values you teach
every good you take you teach them
the things that are good but you let you
let young kids you had a
kids come together and be themselves and
and that would that will get
rid of all your your preciousness and
and racial stuff just let the kids kiss
along
and and i believe that because i say i
don't
i don't want anything to do with
politics my brother and sister could
tell you
the things they do they try to involve
me too i
i'd rather go and do work to uh i think
charles made this thing
before and uh that that's what i do well
but i don't think so i think i do a lot
of things well i just don't have a taste
for it
it destroyed that that taste in
in that now i i still have a sense of uh
of what's fair and what's right and i i
think
what it also did to me my later virgin
idea about racism it's just
just american greed i think that drives
presidents and racism more than anything
else in this country
is greed if if you got on a
on a nice suit you want a better suit
tomorrow if you're driving a nice car
you want a better car tomorrow it's
green
you can look at things at least from my
perspective when i look at things in
this country
it's it's greed that's pushing this
country down
and some and and with greed you come to
my family pride because if i'm breathed
if i
if i'm i'm a
agreed then i agree just understand for
myself
and my family too and and that's what in
my belief that
a lot of the presidents come in because
i'm not gonna let anybody interfere or
disrupt that
but but i think that's my perspective on
the civil rights movement
what it did to me as a as a kid that was
had a happy
very happy childhood went to went to all
white school got jumped on practically
every day if not me one and one of my
my fellow classmates and
then tyler i i don't have i don't have a
taste for it
that's what i think it did to me i think
it changed
my uh my way that that i grew up as a
child to the way that i see things as
as an older person as a man i don't like
the way
the greed and the presence of this
country it goes i
well i worked in the plant behind my
father
they made him a supervisor you know
and i came to work in the plant
what happened to me they couldn't they
couldn't uh
do anything to him because how he was
high so
all of his all the problems fell on me
they
they did meet things i'm saying they
all this all the all the pressure of
what they could do here fell right on me
i was harassed and and mistreated
because of him
you know but and i wouldn't in a
situation do nothing about it because
there were so many against me
you know so you know and
but i deal with you know just another
experience
and don't do experience don't do them
and make you stronger in some other ways
getting more understanding about
different things
but don't kill you make you stronger
yeah that's one thing bob always said
that um anything we experience if
it don't kill you it will make you
stronger and i think about
things that i accomplished in life and i
think about
uh the path i took
and when i kind of got off the path he
would kind of encourage me okay remember
this is what you are working
for and this is your goal and he always
he was like a
supporter and i think by being in the
civil rights room
and seeing somewhat of the progress that
he did make
some of the changes that his marches our
marches made
made me stronger so when i got on the
job and i had different
activities or different things that
happened to me
and i knew it was prejudice that caused
the people to treat me the way they did
i was able to
to to uh survive i was able to
think about okay now if i do a then b
is gonna happen because bob has always
taught us you have to have a plan you
can't just go in there and just
do what you feel you have to do things
that would help the situation and not
hurt it
so it made me stop and think because at
one point in my life i remember i was
very
hot-headed and he was saying you know
you need to do this and you need to do
that
and you know up until the time he passed
he was still giving me advice you know
and it was like
oh i think because of the civil rights
movement
like i said it just made me stronger it
made me to
think logically about things on
on the job when i give advice to my
children
and grandchildren is things that
he has taught me you know what other
people in my life and
jack and bob has always been like oh
you know the best advisor they would
they never judged us
they always advised us and that's what i
try to do for my children too
and you know the thing about uh
the the thing about rob
having the same you know named after his
dad
uh and going through that experience
at crown zeliback uh
that was always that was always a
problem
that was it was always a problem because
uh they would take
what your parents were doing and then
they'll
they'll inflict that on the children and
it was just something that we had to
deal with and it was
very very hard but what i wanted to say
was um
after daddy's death we've had uh
many white people and many black people
to come and call and see
how fair daddy was at that meal
not only to to the blacks but to the
white
that he was the best supervisor that uh
he just was a fair man and one of the
sons
of a person at the mill in the
supervisor position
that he had a lot of problems with his
son recalls when daddy came to his house
and he gave him a uh uh they served him
coca-cola
and dad daddy reached in his pocket and
gave the little boy a quarter of a dime
or whatever it was
and he said he didn't know why but he
was so
happy that mr hicks had given him that
that quarter died
but he said that's why i always
remembered him
and he wanted to call us and tell us
that his dad never said anything bad
about my daddy
well when he wasn't there and i thought
that was that was whatever
but um they always talk about
about the fairness and then it was what
he did
it benefited black and white
in bogalusa and just just everywhere
uh wherever
daddy saw uh injustice he would address
it
anywhere the hospitals
where we could only go to hospitals on
certain days
he filed a suit housing there was
problem with housing where they want to
put it in
only the black neighborhood and wouldn't
get any
information advice as to uh
committee or whatever he stopped the
housing
he made it public housing um
uh the education not the education the
fair
employment for men and women that mama
likes to talk about that
daddy was always concerned that
if a woman does the same job that a man
is doing
then you pay him the same and he always
wanted to fight for that
he also had a passion and you can
clearly see
uh with what's happening with the mass
incarceration
of african americans in this country
uh he would say look at those black boys
just look at all these black boys that
they have put in prison
and some of them for reasons that they
should not have been
in prison but they that's the way it was
they were cute some deserved to be there
but uh the majority the whole idea was
look what the society is doing
and i heard him but i really didn't know
that he had gotten to a point that he
had
sort of moved and i think he might hear
a little less about what king
did in one of his last speeches where he
began to move from the civil rights
to the human right and
i didn't understand exactly where he was
going
until i heard
michelle alexander talking about
the new jim crow with the mass
incarceration and it was like
my daddy was so smart he was already
beginning to get there
to let us see what you are doing
to the black men
and boys in america and then once again
you know shame on you america shame on
you
for what you're doing to those black
boys and people of color
and uh i
i can't even i can't even discuss it
when you when you go down to the to the
prison
and you see more
the percentage the large numbers
of black men that they have working
strong good looking
black men oh
that that's a problem there's a problem
the only thing i can say
you know i know we're limited here but
the only thing i can say
is for america to look at the mass
incarceration
of african-american men and uh people of
color
and do something about it
and that's that's it yeah i think it was
fantastic
okay you won't care how it affects you
oh i forgot greg and rob
had the opportunity to work at the meal
through paul and during the summer when
they would come home
but i don't know if y'all remember one
time i came home from southern and i
said i want to work at the meal or
something
so i went put in my application
they never called
so i said probably they never called me
but everybody didn't work two weeks it's
two weeks into the
summer so he said let me check on it so
he called
bren jay and whoever was out there at
the time
at the at the meal and human resources
and he said yeah we got the application
but
we've done all the hiring he said we all
need to do one more hour
so now we met our quota of summer
workers that we're gonna hire so paul
thought about it he thought about it
and he said one day and he called i
can't think of
is robert something the lawyer at the
time
robert a local lawyer
a local lawyer he said you know what
i got an eeoc case i want you to look
into
and he came to that house tonight we sit
in a den
on robert bobbie street and he talked to
me
and he said talk to paul he said are you
sure you want to go forth with this
are you ready for us to file
on this eeoc that they won't hire you
because
of who you are i said yeah
i'm ready let's let's go forward so we
you know signed the papers and
everything the next week
evidently it got back to
them what we were doing they called me
in for interview
i went in for the interview did well on
the interview everything was
up everything was okay but they found
one loophole
not to hire me when they send me
to the for physical
they sent me through a full
physical and they found a hernia
an inguinal hernia
and that's why the doctor said they
couldn't hire me because
i had to get the hernia fixed so i had
to end up going back to rosenbloom
that summer and we're gonna have to at
the store
and then that was that was really
a doubt because like i said greg did the
hog log and i
i want to get out there and do the hog
log cause if greg could do it
i figured i could work the whole long
work
you know a double shift two double
shifts or whatever
and do it because i just you know that
was just
a tradition you know for everybody to
work on the fall in
in the meal or that and
when i didn't get it and i had to go
back to well i had a you know
job waiting for me doing something but i
had to go back to that that that
that showed me then how much or how
far injustice goes
to to you know with with people
and see that's the point it trickles
down daddy never
daddy never missed that he never would
miss that
when he he would he would kind of ball
bowl his head a little bit and he'd take
his stones like this
and you know you know he was up to
something something he was thinking
about something
and i'm sure that's exactly what he did
with daryl okay let's
let's try this because he always
wanted to file a suit go to court
and get injustice um
and i want to say one thing
when we uh did our tests and
our tests in the public facilities and
we went in
when we went into woolworth
they removed all of the seats
and the counters and they closed it down
so they didn't have to serve black
and my daddy sits up here and he said
that's one thing
that i didn't do i should have fouled
a suit on woolworth across this country
that they if they were going to pull it
down in bogalusa
then they were going to pull it down and
every wool worth they had across this
country
and deal with it because that was uh
they showed us
that we were not going to be served at
woolworth and he said
just didn't i didn't have the lawyers to
do that for me that's the only thing i
regret
you know what your experience at the
summer at the plan
i was 77
yeah okay 77 you know and then that's
like a 10 year that's right that's 10
years 10 years
um let me invite you to offer final
thoughts and
you've been extremely patient and very
generous so thank you all for that
there's more you feel you would like to
say we'd love to hear it
well i'm
you know i asked my daddy once
i said dad do you think that we got an
extraordinary family
and he said nah son i think we're an
ordinary family to god prepared for
extraordinary times
and when i think about my dad and
some of the things that he did in terms
of how
the civil rights movement changed our
family and
did all that one of the things that
my mom and dad were noticed for long
before
they got into the movement was that the
ability to care for the community
there are many kids who are now growing
himself uh who
can tell you about what daddy and mama
did for them
my father and mother were taking uh kids
in the neighborhood to college
to southern uh sometimes to grambling
but none of us were going
but because they needed to go to college
and they didn't have cars
my mother and daddy would pack up pack
their cars and sometimes take two or
three trips
to get kids from burgaloosa to southern
uh they had a fair it was segregated at
that time
but because we had a car my dad would
sometimes make five and six
trips to franklinton fair
so that's 20 miles yeah
so the black kids in our neighborhood or
whoever in the city
who wanted to go to the fair to go and
they paid
50 cents a dollar to go but if they
didn't have the money he said come on
take it anyway
and so they have always been
uh people who cared in the community and
as a family
uh we grew up where family was important
and we literally never did anything uh
that didn't happen with the family you
know we never
uh stayed overnight at anybody's house
uh when my parents went to new orleans
to buy a car the first time they bought
a car and we were saying my
grandmother's
and they came back i guess we were in
bed they came woke us up and took us
home
we never stayed at other people's houses
our
kids could stay with us but we we stayed
uh
when we did something during the summer
uh we went crabbing
as a family we went fishing as a family
we did
so much as a family and the one standard
rule that
we had that was just
that could not be broken was that your
family
and brothers and sisters don't fight and
regardless of whatever happened if
i spit in my brother's face we both got
whipped
because we were brothers and the first
thing we did was fought
not because of well rob said this idea
this the first
principle was that your family and
brothers and sisters don't fight
and that has been a principle that has
carried through
this family uh that has gone on for
generations and generations
and one of the interesting things that
have happened about that is i've watched
my
brothers and sisters with their children
and my nieces and nephews
if they get into a fight and argument or
disagreement
and if one of them says if my if my
nephew greg's son says
well rob's son started it you know what
they tell him
you see all these adults around here
then why didn't you come to somebody
you both were punished and so the value
of family
has been just absolutely very very
important for us as a family
and during the civil rights movement uh
when when our lives changed as barbara
alluded to
you know we were growing up every night
we sat down and had dinner together
and we had to talk about what what
happened to us at school
uh what you know on sundays we had
family prayer together
we did all these things and then all of
a sudden the civil rights movement comes
in
and we're no longer acting as a family
while we were still there
and and doing family things we you know
as much as we could but one of the
things that the reason we were in the
movement
is not because not maybe because we
wanted to
because our parents were in it we were
automatically in it because whatever
they did we did
and whatever they did they included us
so when they got in the movement
we knew we were in it uh that wasn't a
question do you want to be in the
movement
uh we just automatically knew i asked my
dad i said daddy did you ever talk to
greg and peanut butter at the school you
say no i just signed them up
and i asked him i said did that it said
no i said did you want to do it you want
to question the warning
and we were the hicks we were in the
movement and we did it
and i think the miraculous things about
all of this is that
after the movement after all that we've
cut
all that we've been through the many
stress many sleepless nights the fear
the psychological
effect uh the doing without the tax
is that we came back together that we
were allowed to come back together and
be a family again
and that we came out of this as so many
other
black families in small towns and cities
we came out of this thing that we still
have our minds
and when you think about sometimes the
things that black
and if you were to people it long enough
concentrated on it long enough you'll
probably just go insane
but we've been blessed as a family to
come back out of all this same
healthy and silly family well thank you
all so much it's been a
long evening it's especially thank you
for your patience and your generosity
thank you all
honor to be with you thank you thank you
