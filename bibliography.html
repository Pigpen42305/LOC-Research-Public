                <p>Bertrand, Marianne, and Suresh Naidu. Enlisting and Resisting: Explaining the Motivations for Black
                    Volunteerism in WWII. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2020. NBER Working Paper No. 28142.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This paper analyzes over 9 million individual WWII enlistment records (1938–1946) to investigate
                    racial differences in voluntary service, focusing on Black enlistment. It uses a dataset that links
                    enlistment rates to county-level indicators of racial discrimination. Bertrand, Marianne, and Suresh
                    Naidu find that Black men in counties with lower levels of racial discrimination were significantly
                    more likely to volunteer after Pearl Harbor, while enlistment rates in highly discriminatory
                    counties, most of which reside in the South, remained very low. The paper constructs an index of
                    county-level discrimination and includes enlistment patterns.</p>
                <p>The source is reliable and objective, written by respected economists and published by the National
                    Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). It is well-organized, with transparent data. They use principal
                    component analysis (PCA) to measure discrimination, and the inclusion of both qualitative and
                    quantitative history increases the descriptive depth of the study. The source has an academic
                    tuning, but people with a basic understanding of economics might find it amusing.</p>
                <p>Was Matthew’s career harder to come by because he lived in the South?</p>
                <p>This source highlighted major educational and political divides between the North and South in 1940.
                    Counties with higher education and NAACP involvement, correlated with higher enlistment, suggesting
                    more optimism for civil rights progress. This paper is a strong foundation for understanding
                    inequality via geography and how that affected who enlisted. A post war aspect shows access to
                    postwar benefits like the GI Bill lacking in the South and being more easily accessible in the
                    North.</p>

                <p>2 MacGregor, Morris J., Jr. Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940–1965. Center of Military History,
                    U.S. Army, 1981.</p>
                <p>This government publication of almost 700 pages examines the U.S. military's journey toward racial
                    integration from 1940 to 1965. It covers but is not limited to: policies, training programs, and
                    leadership initiatives aimed at advancing the roles of Black soldiers, particularly during and post
                    World War II. The book highlights the Kitzingen Training Center in Germany, which provided military
                    and academic instruction specifically to Black troops, aiming to improve their performance and
                    leadership opportunities within the Army.</p>
                <p>As an official government document, the source is reliable and offers a direct analysis of the
                    military's integration efforts. It is well-organized, providing chronological accounts of policies
                    and programs. However, any reader should be aware of the institutional bias, as it reflects the
                    perspectives of the U.S. military.</p>
                <p>What kind of legal, leadership, or strategic skills did they develop during their service?</p>
                <p>It provides specific examples of how educational programs, like those at the Kitzingen Training
                    Center, were designed to elevate the capabilities of Black troops. The source illustrates the
                    military's role as a significant engineer in promoting equality and enhancing the professional
                    development of Black soldiers. The information is specific, offering insights into the systemic
                    changes and challenges during the integration process.</p>

                <p>3 McMahan, Isaac. “Our Black History Month Blog: Black Veterans and the GI Bill.” Veterans Education
                    Success, 26 Feb. 2021,
                    vetsedsuccess.org/our-black-history-month-blog-black-veterans-and-the-gi-bill/.</p>
                <p>This report by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund examines the economic and educational impact of the G.I.
                    Bill on Black veterans of WWII. The source tells a story of limited access to higher education,
                    scarce amount of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, discriminatory employment practices,
                    and racial bias in housing and financial services. The source also makes connections of this lack of
                    accessibility to the present.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The source is reliable and objective, supported by data, citations and it is organized. It comes from
                    the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, so its purpose is likely advocacy. This makes the source both
                    persuasive and credible for research.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>What educational leverage did the North have over the South at the time?</p>
                <p>The report compares the educational opportunities in the North and the South. It explains that
                    Northern and Western states removed racial barriers from many universities, enabling greater access
                    for Black veterans, while the South remained entrenched in Jim Crow segregation. Black
                    Colleges/Universities in the South were overcrowded, underfunded, and lacked degree offerings.</p>
                <p>Someone like Matthew, a black veteran residing in the South, would face the same barriers in pursuing
                    an advanced career. This makes his success remarkable.</p>

                <p>4 National Archives. “The Great Migration (1910-1970).” National Archives, The U.S. National Archives
                    and Records Administration, 28 June 2021,
                    www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/migrations/great-migration.</p>
                <p>This source provides an overview of the Great Migration, one of the largest migrations in U.S.
                    history. Approximately six million African Americans moved from the Southern states to the North,
                    Midwest, and West between the 1910s and 1970s. It divides the migration into two major waves, before
                    WWII and after WWII. Factors like Jim Crow laws and racial violence caused an incentive to get out
                    of the South, and factors such as industrial job opportunities and improved standard of living
                    provided an incentive to go to the North.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The source is kind of short and lacks detail, but it shows the causes and consequences of the Great
                    Migration chronologically so it is organized at least.</p>
                <p>How were African Americans as a whole treated when returning home? Violence? Praise?</p>
                <p>It talks about the racial violence that followed demographic shifts, particularly during the Red
                    Summer of 1919, showing that African Americans were often met with hostility rather than praise. The
                    implementation of redlining and housing discrimination during the second wave of migration further
                    shows systemic resistance to Black advancement.</p>

                <p>5 “EJI - Explore the Map.” Eji.org, 2019, lynchinginamerica.eji.org/explore.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This source provides an interactive map of the US and shows the amount of lynches per county. The
                    time span covers 1877-1950 and shows that lots of lynches, but not limited to, happening in the
                    South. There is another interactive map that shows the great migration happening 1910-1970. There
                    are also detailed oral stories from African Americans that describe lynching and The Great
                    Migration. There is also a whole film.</p>
                <p>There is truly nothing to critique about this source except sometimes the map doesn't load and I have
                    to reload the site. The amount of information and data it contains is immense but also organized in
                    a way that I can access what I want to see almost instantly. It is objective in the way that it
                    provides data as well as having real individual oral speakers available on the website.</p>

                <p>6 Baldwin, James. The Fire next Time. New York, Dial, 1967.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>What is nice about this book is that somebody already annotated it. It is in the form of 2 letters,
                    the first one directly to his 14 y/o nephew talking about the harsh realities of this world. The
                    second letter is much longer and talks more about relationships between black and other races, very
                    philosophical, not much data, but a nice peice.</p>

                    Roosevelt Era. Chapel Hill, University Of North Carolina Press, 2009.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This book shows the framework for the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s. It discusses the New
                    Deal, introduced by FDR. It showed all the new programs and job openings in the North and its social
                    involvement in the economy for African Americans. What were once rare opportunities started becoming
                    more common post-WWII.</p>
