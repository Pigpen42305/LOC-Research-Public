                But it’s funny the way things are, because I went to New York and got into Columbia University for a stenographic session.
                And then, by that time, I got a job. And my father said, “Well, if you love New York, you’ve got to support yourself.
                We’ve got younger brothers.” I said, “Fine.” I went to the employment office, and they sent me to the NAACP office,
                the national office in New York. And I think that was a blessing, really, because I learned about the racial problems. Only
                then did I learn about the racial problems.And I worked for the—as secretary for the director of branches of the national
                office. And with that job, I got to meet a lot of the local people. I went to the conferences in the different cities,
                annual conventions. I was always there to take the minutes.

                So, it was just the pure luck of having the employment office send you to the NAACP that you got that job?

                And that’s how I got to meet the secretary of the NAACP, the executive secretary, Walter White. And Roy Wilkins, I used to
                call him Pops, and he eventually gave me away in marriage, really, to Thurgood Marshall. He was the legal counsel there.

            <p>
                Well, it was mostly correspondence, but we got to meet a lot of people coming into the city for help and going to the annual
                conventions. And that’s how they got to know me. You know, when Walter White divorced his black wife and married a white
                woman, that practically broke up the whole organization. And so, when Thurgood proposed, I said, “No way.”

            <p>
                Because a lot of people still considered me as a foreigner. Hawaii wasn’t too familiar to people then. So, I said, “No
                way. No.” But he insisted. He said, “I’m marrying you. I’m not marrying the country, and they’re not marrying
                me.” So, and that’s how we got married.

            <p>
                That’s interesting. What was it like to work for the organization when that was happening around Walter White’s
                marriage?

            <p>
                I feel blessed, really, to have been at the organization at that time, and learned a lot for myself, really. And I got to
                know a lot of the local people in different—in the South, especially. They took us in when we couldn’t stay in hotels.
                We stayed in their private homes, and they fed us and treated us like kings.But they themselves, you know, as Thurgood said,
                “We were cowards.” Lawyers were cowards, because they’d go into one city, fight their case, argue their case, and take
                the fastest train and the fastest airplane out.

                But he says, “The local people put their names on the briefs. They stayed there and met daily opposition, hostile people.
                They’re the real heroes in this civil rights fight.”

                Yeah, yeah. I know that there was a lot of hospitality, you know. I’ve read—I was actually over at the Library of
                Congress looking at some of the NAACP papers this past week and reading about some of the annual conventions. What were some
                of the main issues that you remember typing comments on or working on?

            <p>
                Well, I was there for the cases of the Groveland Boys, the four boys that were indicted because they so-called “raped” a
                white woman, all four boys. And I remember Emmett Till case in Chicago. And I don’t know, so many other cases that we were
                involved with, because the branches were responsible for taking care of the cases, but they got advice from our office, you
                know, from the lawyers and from my boss, who was head of all the branches in the country. So, I got to interact with a lot
                of people.

                Well, for instance, going into restaurants, going into hotels, you know, without being looked at or without being turned
                away. And some places we couldn’t even eat in the restaurants, and people fed us. We went to conventions, and they fed us.
                And believe you me, I don’t know how they did it.

                compartment.” And he opened it up. He says, “You see? There’s a Bible there, and there’s a gun there.” He says,
                “We use the Bible first. If that doesn’t work, we use the gun.” That’s how they lived! You know?

                I remember reading about a meeting in Atlanta shortly after the Brown decision, and the excitement and the anticipation that

                Well, I remember about a week after the Brown, the Henderson case—that was a dining room case where the dining room was
                segregated. You know, one section—there’s a section of dining room there, with a wall and a curtain there for the black
                people. And I remember getting in the train going to Chattanooga about a week after that with one of the lawyers. A lawyer
                always is there to confer with the branches. Well, he was traveling, and I was traveling along as a secretary. And his name
                was Franklin Williams, one of the lawyers who became the first Negro ambassador to Ghana, if I’m not mistaken. But he was
                a lawyer then, and he said—and, you know, he could pass for anything. And he said, “Hey, Cis, how about you?” You
                know, he asked my boss, who was pitch black—as a matter of fact, they called him boy, you know. [Laughs]

                couldn’t figure me out, with my long hair and flower in my hair. So, he took us to the table, not, you know, in the
                partition section, but right next to it.And Frank looked at him, and he said, “Pourquoi, monsieur?”And he said, “Oh,
                come back this way,” and took us to the center of the dining room car. And while we were eating, every time Frank saw the

                That they shouldn’t take anything for granted, really. It was people in the earlier days that went through all the
                sacrifice, they went through all the indignities, you know, to be what they are today. So many people take so many things

                Oh, where did we live, John? 123rd Street, 501 West 123rd. Well, we first lived at 409 Edgecombe, which was supposed to be
                the high society of the Negro world. But then, they built a co-op, the first co-op, middle-income co-op in New York. That
                was what they called Morningside Gardens, and it was wonderful! We didn’t have to go out to parties. They all came to us,
                because we had the two young boys. And they didn’t have any, so, it was easier for them to come.

                We had so many friends. There was Ed Dudley, who became ambassador to Liberia, the first ever, before Frank Williams. He
                lived across the building. And there was a doctor there, I can’t think, which was my husband’s doctor. [Laughs] It was
                so convenient! And Bob Carter, one of the lawyers, lived in another building. There were five buildings there, but we were
                all within one community. We lived in one building, and we had Guichard Parris, who was the director of the Urban League,
                they were above us. And we had George Dockery, who was a dentist.And between George Dockery’s wife and Guichard Parris’s
                wife, they tried to buy the boys’ attention. So, one would sneak up and leave food at our front door for the boys. Then,
                we’d come home again another time, and there was food from the other! [Laughs] They would try to outdo one another! They
                were wonderful!

                Well, we lived at 64 G Street, which was walking distance of our church. I still come to this church here. And then, it got
                so that Thurgood couldn’t stand the steps. But we did move to another co-op on 4th Street, which was three stories, but
                more steps. And after one year, he said, “No, that’s enough,” and we found this house in Virginia, which is
