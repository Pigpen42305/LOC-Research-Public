                I sat in the balcony of the Albany movie theater. I drank from the separate water fountain. So, I know a lot about
                segregation as it existed. I remember when I was very young, walking through Kress Ten-Cent Store, and my mother was holding
                tightly to my hand. And a little white boy just about my age walked up and squirted a water pistol in my face. And I tried
                desperately to get away from my mother so that I could catch him. [Laughter] But she kept saying, “You can’t.”

                You know, when my daughter was three years old, I took her to Tift Park, and she saw some white children getting on buses.
                Well, they were rides for them. And she said, “Mommy, I want to ride on that!” And I had to say the same thing to her
                that my mother said to me: “You can’t.”And she turned around and beat her little fists against me, and she said,
                “You don’t want me to ride!” How was I to explain the system to her? So, that meant that I had to take the blame.

                of him and carried him home.But early that Monday morning, somehow the information had gotten to the white supervisor, and
                she came over to the school. And she walked into his room and she told him, “Pack up! This your last day!” And it was.
                He had no recourse, no one to go to. In fact, her husband was the superintendent of Dougherty—of Baker County, school

                had Army barracks in the back of the building. And for about two months, I think, I had to teach in the barracks. I didn’t
                have a room. And then, they moved me into the adjacent building to it.

                it rained, sometimes they couldn’t even get out of the front door. And he had gone down and talked about the situation.
                But he, too, was refused. And even after the Movement was organized, at the very beginning, [clears throat] they had three
                representatives that went before the city commissioners and asked them [clears throat] to organize a biracial committee. And
                they were told that they had no way of doing that.

                Okay. So, from my understanding, some of the earliest things that these people involved from the Criterion Club—one of the
                things that they pointed out that they wanted to discuss was the portrayal of blacks in the Albany Herald newspaper, how all
                the news that was being reported in the Albany Herald was all negative, and it was never any positive news about blacks.

                I remember the crowds. I remember the singing. I remember the crying. And people just making all kind of pleas, you know.
                And it was an emotional meeting, people banding together and singing along with—well, they weren’t called Freedom
                Singers at that particular time, but they were the leaders of freedom songs, like Charles Sherrod and Bernice Reagon and
                Rutha Harris, you know.And I was moved, because I wanted all of the “you can’ts” taken out of my life: the “you
                can’t go to this restroom,” “you can’t eat in this restaurant.” I wanted all of that out of my life, not only for
                myself, but I wanted it out for my children. I wanted them to have a better quality of life than I had, as far as
                segregation was concerned.So, when I—after that meeting, I imagine one or two more meetings, Wyatt T. Walker came down.
                [Clears throat] And he said, “We need some help in the office that was set up in Dr. Anderson’s house for Dr. Martin
                Luther King.” And so, I volunteered and I worked there, you know, for the time that Dr. King had his office there.

                Well, I was answering the telephone, taking messages, and it was awesome sometimes. It was awesome, because Dr. King would
                walk in, thrust a number in my hand, and he would say, “I want to talk to such-and-such a person.” They’d be famous
                people, and he would want me to contact them.

                But as I sat in meeting after meeting and listened to the people who went to jail, and then they came back to the meetings
                and described how they were treated in jail, and I guess I began to think, “My goodness! They know Dr. Martin Luther King
                was here, and they know Sherrod, because he’s everywhere!” I said, “But you have a lot of people, people will never
                know what happened to them, how they were treated, what they sacrificed for equality.”And so, I began to just take notes
                of what some of them were saying. Sometimes I would write on fans; I’d run out of paper in my purse. But I just thought
                that there should be something about what was happening here for future generations. And so, mainly I was thinking about
                children who needed to know.

                Grant had just finished the sermon for that Sunday. And he made the statement, he said that, “After this,” said,
                “I’m going to do something. I’m going to do it for myself and I can do it by myself.” And he stepped out of that
                pulpit and—well, people, you know, they weren’t going to let him do anything by himself.

                them—in one school, the black teachers had a whole hall by themselves, no white teachers there at all. And when grading
                time came, in some schools, they would have to carry the report cards to the principal, so that he could see whether the

                course, I hesitated, you know—procrastinated, I guess I should say, and she passed.

                Well, once I had the organizational technique for it, and I could just go through all the materials and place them according
                to the outline that I had. And so, having the material is what’s important, you know, and I had that, so it turned out to
                be a fairly easy job.The only problem that I had was that I didn’t know anything about publishing a book, didn’t really
                know who to go to talk to. And what I saw was a company that had done religious books. It was out of Columbus, Georgia. And
                my husband and I both, we decided after I had everything together, [clears throat] we would take it to this company, which
                we did. The publisher was—really was fantastic, I can say.What I hadn’t anticipated was the people behind the publisher,
                you know, the copy center, who was—I can see her now, a white lady, who I guess didn’t like all of this material that
                was in the book. And I kept finding errors, you know, and I would go to the publisher and tell him. And, well, I had to pay
                for every mistake that was there, as if, I guess, it were mine.

                And so, finally what happened—I always say God stepped in, [laughs] because I sold out of the first edition. And the
                second edition—we picked up the books like on a Friday, and the company was closed, now, that weekend. I had a book
                signing that Saturday or Sunday. I can’t remember which one of those dates. But when we went through the book, we found a
                page where—you know, on a page where they’re going to put a picture, where the picture goes, they have a blank spot. And
                the directions at the top says, “Drop here,” and they didn’t drop the picture. And printed all those books!

                So, I had a decision to make whether or not I would accept the book, you know, in my mind, and whether I would just not have
                the book signing. But everything was so close until I said, “Well—” I decided I would have the book signing. I would
                explain about the mistake, and once it was corrected, then the persons that bought books would get the corrected copy.

                So, that Monday morning early, my husband and I went to Columbus, Georgia. And, well, the publisher knew that it was his
                mistake and that he would have to account for it. He made all kind of offers to us so that he wouldn’t have to redo the
                whole book. But my husband wouldn’t accept it. So, finally, he said, “Okay, I’ll redo the book.” But when the book
                was printed, he didn’t use “second edition”; he used “third edition.” [Laughs]

            <p>
                Well, I wonder how long it would have taken us to get where we are today had it not been for the Albany Movement. When I
                walk in stores or walk in banks and see black people behind the desks, this is what we accomplished. We might have gotten
                this far, but I don’t know how long it would have taken without the Movement, you know, pressuring these issues. And so, I
                give credit to the Movement for where we are today.And we must remember, too, that the journey is not over. You know, I look
                at—we’ve become so capitalistic, too. And I think of Dr. Martin Luther King and the legacy that he left us of service
                and preparing young people for the future, because the baton is in their hands now. And they must know what to do and how to
                do the things that need to be done.You know, I was thinking about those young people who went into the bus station. That
                really was the beginning of the Movement. They didn’t go there to break laws. You know, they went there to enforce laws,
                the ICC regulation. And those six girls that went into Albany High School, simply because C. B. King struggled eight long
                years after the Supreme Court ruled on desegregation in public schools. So, and then, think now: the laws that helped us
                then are the laws that are being challenged now.
