                Okay. I’m Louise Willingham Broadway. I was born in Baker County, Georgia, a little town known as Newton. I was born in
                1930, 8/6, 8/6/1930.

                Okay, my childhood experience in growing up, I was reared—my parents was farmers, sharecroppers. They did not have a farm
                of their own. And we did not have school buses at the time that I was growing up. We had to walk to school, to church—we
                had schools in church. And we had to walk to school in the cold every morning. Some mornings, it was so very cold you
                couldn’t hardly feel your feelings in your—feel your hands when you’d get to school. But they had an old potbellied
                stove that they would fire up, and we would gather around it and soon get warm.

                The white—well, the children would pass by us on the school bus. They would ride to school. They would ride to school, and
                we would have to walk to school, regardless of your distance. Some children walked as much as ten or fifteen miles to get to
                a church. And yet, the white children on the white buses would pass by them, living in the same neighborhood.

                Yeah. I remember my teachers. One of them was Miss Sallie Mae Terrance and one was Miss Mary Hawkins. We taught—in the
                church, and inside the church, you didn’t have any partitions between the classrooms, you know. They would take about
                three pews, you know, for first grade, and they taught from the first through the seventh, all one—

                And you had to keep quiet, you know. You wouldn’t be disturbing the teacher while she was teaching from one class to

                They had barracks, Army barracks. Maybe, I guess, they were brought in by the state, you know. And they had barracks that we
                would go in from class to class. And they had one little building that they called our chapel in the Home Ec department. And
                that’s where we had chapel and Home Ec department in one building, and then, the other barracks we had different classes.
                The teachers had them at different times.

                [Laughs] Well, I think they spoiled me because I was the youngest. I only had one brother and two sisters. And growing up,
                the second child, which was my sister, she never did want me to do anything. Every time it was time for my chores for
                anything, she would always like to do them for me, because she loved me so. And I think it kind of spoiled me. When she left
                home, then I had chores to do that she used to do for me, and it was kind of hard. But we were a lovely family and we lived
                in a one-room country shack.

                My parents instilled in me that we had to learn to endure with what we had. Regardless of what somebody else had, what they
                could afford to give us, they learned us to appreciate that. We had to go to Sunday School. We had to go to church every
                Sunday, and we had to put church first, regardless of school activities or whatnot. You had to go to church before you go to
                school activities. And they had us—you know, it might have been just meat and bread, but we never went hungry. We never
                went hungry. My father worked at a gristmill, you know, where they grind meal.

                Well, really and truly, my plans were to go to college. But at that time, my father, I told you, worked as a sharecropper,
                and my mother worked, and they was working for from fifty cents to a dollar a day. And at that time, no way in the world,
                you know, they could send me away, and away to school. So, they just—they were not able to send me away to school, so my
                first job was working as a maid in the kitchen, working for a dollar a day.

                It wasn’t anything I could do about it, but I knew that was unfair. But, you know, that was the way it was then, and we
                had to accept it. And so, going to high school, well, they had the Newton High School, that was the white school, and Newton
                Colored High School. So, you know, we never crossed each other’s paths at that time.But then, later on down during the
                years, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, and time, you know, for children to desegregate the schools, I would say it
                like that—okay, then my family—I had married then and had children of my own when this got started.

                heard about we had signed the child to go, then he told my husband that if he didn’t withdraw his name, then he was going

                church. And they had to lie down under the pews and things, because they was firing shots at them at the church on that

                I was looking at some of the notes that I took where one parent was saying one of his children got hit, side of the head,
                with a stick or all this kind of stuff. And then, we would have, you know, the civil rights people, some of them, to come
                down—[Department of] Justice, I would say—and listen to some of the complaints and all of the citizens, how badly they
                were treated, in order to try to make things better. We just wanted equal opportunities.

                See, we had to use the books that the whites used one year. Then, the next year, maybe, or when the books were worn and all,
                torn, those are the books that we would get at our schools. And we just knew that wasn’t justice. And the only thing we

                Yes, he knew. And during my time working with Dr. Shirley, they offered a course down in Baker County, the commissioners
                offered a free course to take on emergency care, to ride on the ambulance, you know, to help to see about our people. And no
                blacks worked on the ambulance at that time.

                And I would work at Dr. Shirley’s office, get off at five o’clock, and at night, I took this course in emergency
                medicine. And I was, you know, one of the first—I was the first black, really, to complete the course in the county, and
                would work at night. Sometimes I was called on duty, maybe at eleven o’clock and had to be at Dr. Shirley’s office

                I really think I’ve about covered the most—the Bloody Saturday was one of those most—most [laughs, then sighs]
                horrible days you have ever heard of in your life or seen, you know, how they were just beating people down to the ground.
                And one of the ladies covered Sherrod’s body to keep them from killing him. They probably would have killed him. That was
                Josie Miller. I know you have heard that story over and over again. Now, that was mostly—one of the most unjust Saturdays
                that I could remember during the Movement time.Now, I can remember one time, though, we marched from First Pleasant Grove
                Baptist Church down to the courthouse to get some people registered to vote.

                Okay, and he was down there that day. And Sherrod was with us. And when we entered, he told Sherrod that, you know, he was
                not supposed to be there. He was not a citizen; he was an outsider. And, you know, he started telling him, “Well, we
                brought people here to get registered to vote.” And, in a split second, he hit him and knocked him over in a corner.

                left. When he left, we all left and went back to the church. But don’t think that stopped us! We were right back down

                Well, after their injuries, you know, they still—we still worked with the Movement and worked in, you know, Baker County
                still until we got people registered to vote and things got a little calmer. He finally got a little bit calmer than he was
                at the beginning, in that there was—you know, people used to be afraid to even come through Baker County, because he was
                going to stop them, and you surely was going to get a ticket, you know. [Laughs] They would go around miles, like around
                Camilla if they wanted to go to Bainbridge, to keep from coming through Baker County. He was just—he was just a mean—he
                just was a mean man, all I can say. He had a service station and he put up signs saying, you know, during our demonstrations
                and everything, that he only wanted white business. He didn’t want black business. But he finally took ill, had—I
                don’t know, he had a stroke or something—and he stayed down for years before his death.
