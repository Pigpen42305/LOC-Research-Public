            <p>
                Today is Tuesday, September 20, 2011. My name is Joe Mosnier of the Southern Oral History program at the University of North
                Carolina at Chapel Hill. I’m with videographer John Bishop in Washington, D.C. at the Jefferson Building at the Library of
                Congress to record an oral history interview for the Civil Rights History Project, which is a joint undertaking of the
                Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress. And we are really honored
                and privileged today to have with us Miss Doris Ann Ladner.

                Um, you set the challenge of opening with a, with a complicated or stimulating question, and I thought I might um, we can
                work back from this, but let me take you back since we’re sitting here on the mall in Washington, D.C. Let me take you
                back to 1963, and, uh, I want to ask about the March, but most particularly I want to ask about the ambivalence and the
                range of thought and feeling and criticism you had about that experience because I know it was a complicated question that -

            <p>
                Well, my feelings were, uh, one of ambivalence and complicated in that, uh, there were so many things going on on the front
                line, meaning that Medgar Evers had been killed on June 12th. His funeral was June 16th and, uh, Lawrence Guyot had been
                beaten; Miss Fannie Lou Hamer had been jailed and beaten very badly in Winona, Mississippi, and there was a bus boycott
                going - not bus boycott but a boycott of all the stores in Jackson, Mississippi, and people were being arrested in
                Greenwood, Mississippi. We were under siege. So, uh, we knew that we had to return back to these homes. We had three guys on
                death row in Georgia. Um, so coming together was good to address, bring our, um, grievances to the seat of government to let
                the President and everybody know, but we knew that we had to return back to those towns. And what would be waiting for us. I
                really looked forward to coming here and to letting everybody know what was going on. But in reality, James Farmer, who was,
                uh, executive director of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] was in jail in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. He couldn’t
                attend. So, uh, my sister Joyce worked in the March on Washington office coordinating the, uh, transportation and working
                out the logistics. And I was working in the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office, uh, raising money for
                the organization’s livelihood and also, uh, recruiting people to participate in the same, uh, um, march. But the point was
                I was always thinking about what was going on because I’m a frontline person. And always thinking about the strategy, and
                my sister was talking about the fun that we had and I was thinking about the other side of it. And I said, wanted to say,
                and death shall have no dominion over what we were doing at the same time because we didn’t fear death as well as enjoying
                ourselves partying and so forth. We were young and, uh, zealots, we were zealots. So, uh, in essence, oh, the one thing that
                bothered us was that uh, we didn’t sing, [laughs] which always kept us going. And, uh, when they wanted to change John’s
                speech [John Lewis’s March on Washington speech], but I’ll let Joyce talk about that because uh, she was involved back
                there with Courtland [Cox] and Jim [Forman] and so forth. But that was one thing that turned us off. And we were always
                busy. You know we had all this energy, energy. Nineteen, twenty years old, you’re very energetic.

            <p>
                Very busy. Um, I was at a conference, student conference, in Lake Forest, uh, Illinois, the day that Medgar Evers was
                killed. And I had gone there as a SNCC representative to try to recruit students and also to raise money and to spread
                generally spread the word about the southern movement. I got a call, um, while I was at this conference one evening from
                Ruby Doris Robinson. Now Ruby said, “Joyce, Medgar has been killed.” And I said, “Oh my God. I've got to go home. I've
                got to get back to Jackson.” And she said, “No, you need to go to Washington to work on the March on Washington.” I
                said, “Yeah, but I've known Medgar, you know, since I was fourteen.” I mean, I was very upset. I started, I think I was
                even crying. I’m sure I was. And she said, “But we need to send two representatives from SNCC to work on the March, and
                I want you to go from there, from uh, uh, get you an airline ticket and I want you to go to New York City to, for the rest
                of the summer to work on the March.” And she said, “This is” - I remember so clearly - “this is what Medgar would
                have expected of you, or wanted you to do.” One or the other she said. And I was, like, taken aback, and I - but I always
                had the ability to think with my head even in difficult, emotional times. So, I saw the logic of what she, anyone could
                appeal to my logic. So she appealed to that part of me. And so I was then off to New York to work um, at, at the Harlem
                Headquarters for the March on Washington. And, uh, I spent the summer there working under Bayard Rustin’s direction. Uh,
                there, uh, we, Dorie and I stayed with Rachelle Horowitz who was a young person, and she lived, uh, at West 8th Avenue and
                24th Street in ILGWU [International Ladies Garment Workers Union] condo apartments. And she had a one-bedroom apartment
                there. Dorie and I slept on the sofa and then later in the summer Eleanor Holmes [later Eleanor Holmes Norton] arrived, and
                she, she was at Yale Law School, and she came and she, uh, joined us up at March headquarters. So Dorie, while Dorie was
                working out of the SNCC office, Rachelle, Eleanor and I worked up in the Harlem office of the March. And my job really was
                to raise money. So I went out on Long Island. I went out to New Jersey, around the city spreading, uh, the word about the
                March and why it was so important to bring, uh, people who were involved in the Movement from the South to participate in
                the March. So El, uh, Rachelle, uh, used to say that every time Joyce went out to raise money, she came back with enough to
                rent another bus. So, [laughs] uh, and that was [phone in background] what was important to us. I, I - we worked long hours.
                We worked on Saturday and it was very tiring. One Saturday I remember seeing Malcolm X for the first time. He was, he used
                to speak on the corner of 125th Street, and I stopped and listened to him speak, and as I said we worked very long hours. We
                did whatever Bayard [Rustin] told us to do. So it was, it was, uh, it was -

                Very well organized. I was, he was a, a great organizer. He had a very clear tactical sense, and he saw the big picture, and
                he, you know, anything he asked us to do we did because, um, but he also left us with enough flexibility you know to, to be
                independent to go out there and do what had to be done. Um, so every night we worked late at night, came into, back to the
                apartment and, and there was ‘Bobby’ Dylan sitting on the sofa, strumming his guitar, and I wanted to go to sleep. And
                he would sit there until midnight, and I just couldn’t wait until he would go to sleep. But he was sitting there
                entertaining Dorie, and, um, uh, you know he wasn’t, he was well known, but you know we were all young people at the time.
                I didn’t see him as any great, you know, famous person or anything because we were peers in a way, and we, then we went
                down, flew down to Washington, uh, for the march, the day before, and we stayed at what, what was then called the Statler
                Hilton Hotel. It’s now, um -

                I’m not sure what the official name of the hotel is, but it was, back then it was called the Statler Hilton. And it was
                the March hotel, and I remember, um, there were a lot of media people, a lot of people who were there for the march, um, and
                I remember, uh, meeting Malcolm X - seeing him rather - in the lobby after the March, and I’m pretty sure I saw him there
                before the March occurred as well.

                So we picketed them about six o’clock that morning. Then we got ready earlier went on over to the mall for the March. I
                had a pass, a stage pass, because I was on the staff. And so what I remember first was seeing all those people. It was an
                incredible sight. A nineteen year-old from Mississippi who had never seen huge numbers. In fact no one on that platform had
                seen numbers like that before. But I remember seeing people march, coming and coming and coming and they just kept coming.
                Um, and then I saw the people on stage, and I think I might have been impressed by some of them, but I think probably most
                by uh, uh, Josephine Baker [laughs]. She was the person I remembered most because she was a legend, and I could not imagine
                that I would have ever met her. She was very gregarious and exotic-looking and, and she was shaking everyone’s hand and
                hugging people and so on. And, um, then seeing the actors, people in movies up there and that was, even though there were
                people who were involved who were very strong supporters of SNCC, you know, who were, uh, who raised a lot of money for us.
                And then I, then seeing the union guys on stage, uh, and seeing Mahalia Jackson and hearing her sing. Um, in other words, it
                was just - it cut across a swath of a lot of people, you know, who were, swath of America on that stage. I remember seeing
                Marlon Brando and I used to, I felt I got the kind of chills when I saw him and Josephine Baker, and I was thinking more
                than anything else that our support really ran deep you know. Uh, that was what, what, uh, I felt. And I saw Lena Horne, and
                I had met her earlier in the summer because -

                But we, also I met her at the Delta Sigma Theta convention that summer in New York when, when Joan Trumpauer [later, Joan
                Trumpauer Mulholland] who was later my roommate at Tougaloo [College], and, um, Joyce Barry who worked with SNCC in
                Southwest Georgia and I, we were all Deltas. There were two white girls who were Delta, who were members of Delta Sigma
                Theta and I, and we were all in the Movement. So we, uh, Jeanne Noble [Dr. Jeanne Laveta Noble] who was the Delta Sigma
                Theta president at the time and was from Albany, Georgia, uh, and a professor at the time at Brooklyn College, later at NYU,
                invited us to speak about what was happening in the South. And the Deltas were very activist-oriented, and they, uh, used to
                bail other Deltas, young Delta soros out of jail in the South. And so, uh, we spoke about at the convention about what was
                happening. Lena Horne talked about having been down in, in, um, Jackson, and she had a very, very strong, deep emotional tie
                to the Movement, very unusual, she, she felt it in her solar plexus, I think.

                Her mother had - according to her biography, her mother had taken her to Georgia - her natural mother, because she was
                reared by her grandmother - her father’s mother had taken her to Georgia, and she stayed for a long period of time and she
                so identified with that area because you know she never lost her southern accent. And Billy Strayhorn was also with her, and
                her son. So, uh, and I remember being at a house there in Jackson with uh, Dr. Noble, president of Delta, Lena Horne, Dick
                Gregory, and I’m not sure who else. Medgar Evers was there, and they were all talking. Here, I’m like twenty, nineteen
                or twenty years old sitting there observing them, and the one thing that, about Lena Horne was that uh, when Joyce and I
                were on the platform at the Lincoln Memorial, the Brit - the, uh, French television, uh, wanted to interview her. She said,
                “No, these are the young people you should interview.”

                reporter, television uh, news person uh, was up on a scaffold. And we climbed up the scaffold and she told her, “Interview
                this young person, because, young woman, because she lives in the South and she knows what it’s like.” So, she was very
                generous in that regard, and I remember being interviewed and when I got back home a week later to Miss - Hattiesburg, my
                mother said, “I saw you on TV,” and that was like, so, this was 1963. You know, you remember, fifty years, almost,
                almost fifty years ago, and it was - television wasn’t what it is now. So it was so strange. And Mother said, “Yeah, all
                the neighbors,” said, “Miss Katie [Grice] saw you, and Miss Ida [Bettis] saw you,” and [laughing] she went on all the
                neighbors who had seen me as well. And my younger sisters and brothers had as well. And that made, uh, our mother was a

                that number one, something could happen to us, and also she always worried that the house would be burned down by the Klan.

                Yeah, that was the mantra that passed through five generations of our family, uh, uh, maternal line of our family. We can go
                back in a minute and talk about that. But, but Mother, uh, always, she was - while she had ambivalence and some fear and
                trepidation about our involvement. What I always remember is that she never told us not to go. And that was important. She
                never said stay here. Never. And so when, I remember on that day we, you know, being interviewed by a French media reporter
                and then uh, uh, Nancy Dickerson at NBC. And so it was, but what, what bo - I remember most is John Lewis’ speech because
                I was on the podium with Courtland [Cox], uh, Mildred [Mildred Thompson Forman, later Mildred Page] and Jim Forman, and
                John. There were others around, but that small core group of people was when John was saying, “Well, I don’t want to
                change anything. I don’t want to,” and you know, he wasn’t screaming or shouting because he, he’s soft spoken. And
                Jim was saying, “Well, they should, they shouldn’t be telling - who is this archbishop telling us what to do?” And of
                course as word spread out in the crowd to the SNCC people, everybody got very upset because this was our speech, and what we
                felt most of all was that, “This archbishop doesn’t know what we go through. Who is he? What right and authority?” -
                we always challenged authority. “Who gave him the right to decide what John should say?” And it was, there was a crisis
                on the, on the platform for a while. Then finally the language was changed as little as possible, and he gave the speech.
                But that was, that and the guy, our friends being in jail in Americus, Georgia were the defining things that I remembered
                most, that I remember now, about the March. Of course I remembered King’s speech, but we had an ambivalent relationship
                with King as well. We called, you know, referred him as ‘de Lawd,’ D-E-L-A-W-D, like the Lord you know. And everybody is
                looking up to him when in fact, the SNCC people went into the most dangerous areas like Albany and other places, and we
                called it breaking an area: staying there under the toughest conditions until you finally have a breakthrough with the local
                community when they begin to let you stay with them. Then you began to, uh, they come out to the meetings and they start
                getting involved and organizing as well. And then it builds up to a crisis stage, and that’s when King would come in, we
                felt. And so we had an ambivalent relationship with him. We respected him of course. But it wasn’t all, “Oh, this is a
                fantastic man. This great speech he gave,” because it was - that wasn’t it. The reality was that we knew we were leaving
                that next day. I left the next morning with John Lewis on a flight back to Atlanta. Funny what you remember. I remember the
                plane was - in the back of the airline there was a round seating area, like a circular sofa back there. And John and I were
                sitting back there. Um, and we went to the SNCC office, and, and I went back there because I was waiting for a ride back to
                Hattiesburg because a week later I was going back, going back to Tougaloo for my senior year. How did you get back?

                seen that as something that I savored and carried with me because we couldn’t for long because we were right back in that

                Yes, the stress. I would go to sleep at night not expecting to wake up. Yeah, and, uh, it was unusual because I've never
                seen a telephone that would ring in your hand, and it’s off the hook. And, uh -

                Literally holding the phone, take the phone off the hook, the receiver, and it’s still ringing because people in the South
                go to bed very early and the phone would start ringing about, between six-thirty and seven and uh, they would leave their
                phones off the hook so we had no contact with the outside world. And, uh, we lived right beside an alley; so we never knew
                whether or not we were going to wake up. And I developed stomach problems from eating, from the, it was pure stress, pure
                stress. But, uh, it made me more determined, so determined one time that I went to, um - Mr. Charles Evers had gotten, maybe
                close to eighty people arrested, and they were taken to Parchman Penitentiary, and I never followed him because I didn’t
                think that he was -

                I didn’t respect him. And so, uh, we were trying to get the bond signed. You needed two signatures, the chief of police,
                and you needed a property owner and so I got so frustrated because we were tr - in the Delta we had to travel from Natchez,
                which is in the far south, to the Mississippi Delta which is probably two hundred miles to get people out. And I asked one
                of the police officers, “Where is the chief of police?” and they said, “He’s at the Holiday Inn.” So I got a cab
                and went to the Holiday Inn, which was segregated and stood and had him paged. I was at the desk, the cashier’s desk and
                had him paged standing in the middle of the floor. I was that frustrated and that angry. And so he never responded. I
                don’t what he - I would’ve done if he had confronted me. I don’t know, but that was the height of level of frustration
                that one would get to. So I got in a cab and went back to the house. And another time I remember getting very frustrated was
                the next day after Medgar was killed we went to the, um, Masonic temple, um, Dave Dennis from CORE, his wife, Mattie Bivens

                - and myself went to the Masonic temple, and, um, there were two white police officers sitting on motorcycles, and I ran up
                to them and started screaming, “Where were you last night? Why are you here now? Shoot! Shoot! Shoot us in the back like
                you did Medgar Evers. Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!” just screaming, just enraged, enraged. The amount of rage I can’t even begin
                to describe. And it was anger, frustration, hurt, pain, all everything that you could think of, and they sat there with
                their heads bowed, and only recently have I begun to think that they practiced non-violence with me because they never
                responded.

                I don’t know. The insight is beginning to come to me as I get older and think that they looked sorrowful themselves. They
                had their heads down. They never glared at me. They never looked at me. They never made any towards me gestures. They just
                sat there, and I was really enraged. And it only came to me recently that they were using the same tactics, non-violence
                tactics, passive resistance, with me that we used with them.

                that a lot of whites in the South and in Jackson in particular did not care for that. Although I went to both trials, uh,
                for Medgar, and the first trial was alright although I had to kick some white men’s feet because they put their feet on
                the bench and wouldn’t let me sit down. I kicked their foot and told them to move it and then sat down. That’s the type
                of temper I had.

                The fried foods. We ate at what we called the White House restaurant that was owned by some sisters who were independent.
                They had lots of land. And, um, every time I would eat, the food would come up, fried chicken, and now to this day I watch
                my diet. I can’t eat fried foods and this is, um, hereditary I would imagine.

                I think all of us felt that what drove us was that we felt number one, that we were doing the right thing. We never
                questioned whether or not the cause was not, not a just one. I mean that was a foregone conclusion, but I think my sister
                endured a lot more dangerous situations by far than I did. But at the same time, I mean I was in enough dangerous situations
                just, uh, but I always felt that, that - I was always scared. And I, and I didn’t want to be around people in the Movement
                who would say, “I’m not scared.” You know, because especially if they were northerners because they could get you
                killed very easily because they didn’t have respect for the local traditions and because we southerners knew what those
                conditions were, we could decode, decode them a lot quicker and easier, more easily than, than the northerners. A lot of
                times they acted out of ignorance but because, my roommate Joan Trumpauer and my senior year at Tougaloo, for example, used
                to say, “I don’t care about these people. They’re not going to do anything to me.” And I said, “Well, you’re not
                going to get me killed.” I used to carry around a black scarf in my pocket, and when we were driving back to Tougaloo
                College at night on this long stretch of, of road called Hanging Moss Road, there were no lights. And Tougaloo was eight
                miles from downtown Jackson. So we had, I used to put her on the floor. If she wouldn’t get on the floor I'd say, “Well,
                you’ve got to put this scarf on you because your long blonde hair is not going to get me killed.” And because people you
                know would’ve shot at us even if they’d just known we were movement workers, and we were - and there were no whites in
                the car. But I came to understand, I guess, as I got older that, that fear doesn’t mean inaction. I mean it - courage was
                the ability to act or to prevail in spite of one’s fear. Um because you could easily be paralyzed by your fear if you - I
                mean, in my mind was constantly working. I was sitting there I remember once Lawrence Guyot told me in a SNCC meeting, he
                said, “Joyce if we listen to you, you know, you take everything to its logical conclusion. We wouldn’t do anything.” I
                said, “Well, I didn’t mean it that way,” I was just trying to point because my mind is always working on this hand, on
                that hand, da, da, da, da, da. These are the, this is what would happen in one scenario. This is what would happen in
                another. I said, “But I didn’t mean not to do it. I just was thinking about what could happen.”

                as a little child. I was always curious about all these things taking place, and then she would get, she and he got out of
                the car and went in, in her house, and I just assumed with my young mind that he was, they were having intimate relations.
                He come out an hour or so later, and what I wondered back then was, “Why does she have to pay him money and then have sex
                with him?” I couldn’t understand that as a little, a young child, I was ten or twelve years old.

                Yeah, because we became very independent very early. Now what mother also taught us was to, we, we observed the way she
                navigated. If a man, insurance collector, came by the house, they never came in our house. She met them at the, on the front
                porch. She never let them in the house. And they didn’t make passes at her. There was a certain, um, sense of pride and no
                nonsense behavior that she, she uh - she never let her guards down with them, not at all. And she treated them, kept them at
                distance. She did not kowtow. She did not let them allow them to make her feel that they were superior ever. See, going back

                Mary, and a white, um, man named Benjamin, Ben [Benjamin F. Woulard; Ms. Dorie Ladner later pointed out that the Woulard
                name has been variously rendered over generations as Woolard, Woulard, Wollard, and Woullard]. And he, Dorie did the
                genealogical research but at one point, they told us, they passed on a lot of folklore about him, and he said that he would
                not see his blood spilled across -

                And so they didn’t put themselves in a lot of environments where they had white bosses. Uh, for example one uncle, Uncle
                Joe, uh, used to repair electronic things. And one day he went to this white man’s house. The man told him to come fix his
                TV and he said he saw the screen was all broken. And he said, “Well, what happened here?” The man told him, “Well, I
                saw this nigger on TV last night kissing this white woman and I shot him.” [Laughing] And we just all laughed and my uncle
                said, “Don’t you know that’s crazy? I mean why would you shoot him? You want me to fix it?” He said, “There’s
                nothing I can do with your TV.” And he turned and walked away, and you could see my uncle had good sense. But this man,
                they’re looking a lot of white people who were like inferior to them in a way. I mean, that’s the way they looked at
                them. And they didn’t allow anyone to, to beat up on them or treat, mistreat them even when they worked for whites. Um,
                they tell, they used to tell us these stories of how they got in a fight with this person and “We beat him up” or
                whatever, and they were white. And I would just sit there marveling, “Oh, that’s fantastic,” you know, because it was
                just the opposite image that you had of the downtrodden Negro. But they just weren’t like that. And so that was the model
                we got, and, we felt that when we joined the Movement we were doing what they had prepared us to do. I mean, and they were
                all very proud of us.

                today, uh, Dr. Ladner you were talking about, um, just that rush of feeling and uh, so much excitement and a whole cluster

                The Movement was the most exciting thing that one could engage in. I often say that, in fact I coined the term the “Emmett
                Till generation.” I said that there was no more exciting time to have been born at the time and the place and to the
                parents that movement, young movement people were born to. It was through an accident of history that we were that post-war
                generation in the South at the time, who had the parents who taught us, stand up for yourself. That all of that thing, I
                mean you’re talking about synchronicity and serendipity, I mean all those things fell into place for a small group of
                young people and that was our generation. That we were postwar kids. Some of our parents had gone, fathers had gone abroad
                to fight for freedom and they came back and they were so disappointed. We were that, uh, the era if you’d been in the
                North the suburbanization of America. You know where the, the white kids’ fathers were getting the jobs, and they were,
                had the economic ex - expansion and the material goods, and we saw that we weren’t getting those. We were that generation
                that had been brought up with the fire and brimstone, uh, of believing the Old Testament prophets on justice and you know
                just, uh, a strong sense of right and wrong. It was the morality of our times, uh, that we believed that it was, uh,
                according to the Bible it was wrong to segregate people and to treat one group of people better than the other. Uh, we grew
                up with the liturgy of the church, Baptist church that we translated to the Civil Rights Movement, the songs and, um, the
                [cough in background] and the preaching and the testifying. All that took place in those mass meetings. All these were
                factors and we were that, of that generation where most important of all it was that all of us were imbued with the sense by
                our parents and our aunts and uncles and our neighbors who said that you are the generation that will do better and your
                generation will change things. I remember so clearly Uncle Archie who was in World War I, went to France, and he always told
                us, “Your generation is going to change things.” And so there was these expectations of us, and I think we, we fulfilled
                them. But I don’t believe it was, it was, through, you know, obviously it was not a matter of King standing up in
                Montgomery and people saying well, you’re right. It was, for us it was almost like you had to do it. It was a matter of
                time; the time had come. And they expected so much of us. Our teachers used to tell us -

                They said you’ve got to get an education because no one can take that from you. And, I think often my mother used to say
                that all the time, and but she grew up in a time when they took their labor from them. They took everything from them and
                gave them little compensation for anything. Our stepfather made thirty, thirty or thirty-five dollars a week as a skilled
                mechanic, diesel engine mechanic. His employer used to send him to New Orleans to these training courses, and he retired on
                social security whereas the white men working alongside him, you know, had had pensions. Uh, and they understood the
                injustices, and while they may have felt they couldn’t do anything abut it, there was this spirit of rising expectations
                that, that we would do it. And we had so many mentors. I remember one of our mentors was an herbalist. We called him Dr.
                McCloud, and we called him Cuz. He was a cousin of our aunt. He used to come sit on the porch and talk to mother and he was
                member of the local Hattiesburg branch of the NAACP. He subscribed to the Pittsburgh Courier and Chicago Defender, Jet, and
                Ebony magazines, and he read. So he would bring us books. He brought us, um, every week he brought us these publications.

                That we got. Because everything was censored, everything. The radio, there was one TV station, uh, in Hattiesburg. I
                remember when it came, arrived, and they would call you niggers on, on screen. Uh, and we, that, that outside information
                just fueled our curiosity and fed it and made us want to see the world and do things differently. It gave us the window into
                how the outside lived. We saw that kids were going to college in Chicago and in Pittsburgh and all over the North. And it
                made us see how, allowed us to see how other people were actually living, you know, and that that could be ours as well. But
                first we had to get rid of this little matter of segregation, discrimination.

                Clyde Kennard was our youth chapter adviser, and, but the tragic thing was that, uh, we were so young when he was jailed,
                and we knew that it wasn’t right, the first time he went on campus and they said they found moonshine in his car. We were
                looking at it from a distance. We knew him; we didn’t think that he would ever do anything like that, but it was, uh, so
                far away from him. And when he was incarcerated, he stayed in jail in Hattiesburg over a year, and we could go downtown and
                walk past the jail -

                Yeah, we were kids. The other thing you have to think about here is that look at this from the perspective of fourteen,
                fifteen year-olds. Uh, who know it’s not, these things are not right and who would just love to some day figure out how to
                make everything right. Uh, but being, also being, very powerless. I will never forget how Dorie and I responded to Emmett
                Till’s lynching. We used to go to the, uh, the Hudson Store every day at 4:20, 4:15-4:20. That was when the, we had, the
                city bus ran, went through to, to, from downtown Hattiesburg out to Palmers Crossing and they brought the Hattiesburg
                American on that bus, 4:15-4:20. And we ran up there with a dime every day and bought our copy of the newspaper. And I
                remember I used to clip out, clip the paper about Emmett Till’s lynching. Talk about feeling powerless and frightened but
                also just like this is awful.

                call his name right now, but, uh, on Emmett Till and Mrs. Mobley [Emmett Till’s mother, Mrs. Mamie Till Mobley] was
                talking, was talking - Emmett Till’s mother - was talking, and she was describing how he looked when she went to the
                funeral home. They wanted to bury him right then and there without opening the casket and she went on, she said, “No, I
                don’t have time to faint. I don’t have time to do this, cry and all this.” So she described each part of his body and
                all of a sudden I told my daughter, “I’m going to sleep.” And this was three weeks ago. I could not at this age, uh,
                let that into my psyche. I just went straight to sleep and slept maybe two hours and then I woke up.

                Everyone I knew in SNCC, every black southerner for sure, had seen that photograph, and it was like a clarion call for
                action and that when we got older we were going to avenge his death. I mean, I can remember feeling that so strongly. I
                remember clipping those Hattiesburg Americans every time there was an article about the Emmett Till case and the trial, and
                I kept a scrapbook. I wish I had kept it for years. I really wanted, to, I remember taking it up to my playmama’s. We had
                these teenage girls who would be your playmama. They were like nice to you and so on, like a young sister, younger sister
                and mine was Modell Stewart. I remember one day taking this, this uh, uh, scrapbook to her house and I remember lying on the
                floor on my stomach, flipping through, showing it to her. I remember crying, um, and feeling so terribly vulnerable, but at
                the same time feeling that one day I’m going to do something about this. That was always the feeling that you could see
                these horrible things happening to people, but one day it’s not going to be like this because I’m going to help to
                change it. I’ll never forget how the second lynching we experienced, you know, was that of Mack Charles Parker in
                Poplarville [MS], which is now fifteen minutes from Hattiesburg. Back then it was probably forty-five minutes on the old
                roads. And that was close to home. I remember the international media came to Hattiesburg because Hattiesburg had a hotel.
                It was the largest city in the - they called it the hub city for these smaller towns nearby. And Dorie and I would go up to
                town, as we called it, get on the bus and go to town and stand, we stood on the streets listening to these international
                reporters with foreign accents and speaking in a foreign tongue. And one time we were just pretending we were foreign, too.
                We would just [speaks in gibberish]. We didn’t know what we were saying. [Laughing, speaks in gibberish] Just like making
                up words. I felt like they’re our friends. They were, they’re our friends because they’re here to tell the world about
                this, and any time I saw anyone that I felt was exposing what was going on I felt a sense of empowerment. But, um, I
                remember also after Mack Charles Parker was lynched. And as I said it was so close to home that I remember my mother started
                pulling the boys and my father in closer, like “Fred, you’d better be” - my brother next to me in age - “Fred, be
                home before dark.” You know, I mean, it was like that natural, that protective instinct was to make sure that - because in
                a way after a lynching we felt there was a lot of fallout from it. It was not an isolated event. It empowered the races
                because they would stand out with their chests stuck out, and they’d talk about the niggers this and the niggers that.
                “They should’ve killed that nigger. I wish I’d been there. I would’ve done whatever to him. I would’ve kicked him,
                too, or I would’ve gotten me a shot on him.” And so, it, these were catalytic agents for you know all the races and just
                a flourish out in the open. And so it was that you, which you feared as much as the actual event that had occurred as well,
                because it was like the climate coming forth. It was like Sarah Palin [former governor of Alaska] getting out here and
                stirring up the Tea Party you know. Like, uh, it’s not just Palin, Michele Bachmann [U.S. Congresswoman from Minnesota]
                but, but when they come around, they start talking and then all the other people who feel like them come out as well, you
                know. And that was the way I felt with these lynchings.

                No, and one of the most, while I’m thinking about it, one of the most horrendous times that I experienced was when we went
                to found COFO [Council of Federated Organizations] in August of 1962 in Clarksdale, Mississippi. This was my first time
                going to the Delta after Emmett Till and all this had happened. Um, Bob Moses, um, Dave Dennis, Mattie Dennis, Colie Lidell
                , uh, and I’m not sure. Quite a few of us went up there. And Clarksdale had a curfew. I didn’t know that. All blacks off
                the street at twelve midnight. And when we got into the church, shortly after we got into the church, here comes the fire
                truck. There’s no fire here. And so when the meeting was over we were all subject to being arrested for passing the curfew
                that we didn’t know anything about on our way trying to get to Jackson, and it was darker than a thousand midnights in the
                Delta. If you’ve been up there, you don’t see anything but the stars. And, um, so Dave Dennis was driving our car, and
                we, the police got us before we got to Mount Bayou, which is an all-black town. And so we stopped along this dark road, and
                the police took him to his car and talked about him, Dave’s, is of mixed heritage. They discussed that with him. Then he
                told him he was going to take him to jail. So Dave came and told us to follow them back to Clarksdale to the jail, and uh,
                because he was going to lock him up. So we didn’t know anything about the Delta. And Lester McKinney, who was one of the
                Freedom Riders from Nashville, was driving the car. So when we got to Clarksdale to the jail, the officer, one of the
                officers said, “Get the F out of Clarksdale.” And so here we are driving around and around it around trying to find
                Amzie Moore’s house. Amzie Moore was a World War I veteran who had work, done a lot of work in Mississippi with the NAACP

                six o’clock. We had to go through Ruleville, and we had been told that Milam [J.W. Milam, who with his brother-in-law is

                people were living under and maybe some still are. I don’t know but it was - And then we said we’re going to do

                The difference between us was that I always had one foot in university, college, and one out, and Dorie dropped out of
                school. Dorie told me once, “Joyce I can’t stay in school and know my people are suffering.” And I was always trying
                to figure out how I could do both. So when she left college, I was very upset, but at the same time I knew that was her
                calling, and I always did my movement work alongside my campus work. I was more campus-based in a way. And, but still spent
                time, you know, out in the community organizing as well.

                And I had, when I went to, back to Jackson for the fiftieth Freedom Rider reunion last summer, I met a young black man who
                replaced Judge Cox. It was the most amazing thing. I couldn’t believe. He said, I told him I said, well, he was introduced
                at this, uh, dinner that he was, um, on the Fifth Circuit, and I went up to him afterwards and I said, I said, “Oh,” I
                said, “I was tried by Judge Cox.” And he said, “I replaced him.” I said, “You’ve got to be kidding.” I said,
                “This is poetic justice I've ever heard of it.” I couldn’t believe it. It was truly remarkable, fifty years later.

                they were seasoned because it didn’t take long to get seasoned, become a seasoned volunteer. Because you were, it was a
                baptism of fire. As soon as you got there you got thrown in feet first. Uh, but I remember all the debates that we had about

                Freedom Day in January 1964 in Hattiesburg was the precursor to Freedom Summer. Um, and the MFDP, we, you know you could
                only organize for so long to get people to register to vote before you bring attention to the fact that these same people,
                not only can they not vote, but they can’t be apart of the political, um, party and so we started organizing uh,

                Now, now, I remember the statewide convention was held at the Masonic Temple, uh, this was the statewide Democratic,
                Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party convention. And after the delegates were chosen, then we, I remember riding up to
                Atlantic City in a convoy of cars with Cleve Sellers [Cleveland Sellers Jr.] and Ivanhoe Donaldson. And each person in SNCC
                had a skill and I, I like to think of the drivers, the skill, the very, very important skill that was, that was acquired,
                that was used to drive, as a driver. SNCC driver of the Sojourner Fleet of cars. Ruby Doris Robinson named them the
                Sojourner Fleet by the way. Because you had to be able to drive in very dangerous places. You had to get in and out of
                places like Dorie was describing earlier, being up in the Delta. And you had to outrun the cops, and we drove in a convoy of
                cars up to Atlantic City. We stopped in Denmark, uh, South Carolina at Cleve Sellers’s parents’ home, and we showered,
                changed, and his mother cooked a great meal. Then we went on to, second leg of the trip on up to Atlantic City. And we had
                walkie-talkies, too so, you know, cars we traveled in a fleet together. So I think it was about three cars together. I’ll
                never forget that trip up there. Um, and then once we got there, I remember we stayed at, I stayed at the Y [YWCA]. Uh -

                And we towed that car up to, uh, Atlantic City, put it on the boardwalk and, uh, different people stood there and explained
                what it was, uh, as people at the convention stopped. And I remember being, standing there and people wanting to know what
                is that, what is that, and then once you told them this is what the three Freedom Riders, uh, three civil rights workers
                were in, driving when they were, before they were killed, then it just took on - I mean it was the symbolic manifestation of
                just the most utter type of fear and they could understand. See one thing we, we understood in the Movement, and I’m not
                sure how, as young as we were, how we understood, came to understand that but we showed people what it was like as much as
                possible. It was a tactile thing. Like lots of photographs, a lot of booklets we put together. We uh, freedom ballots, uh,
                uh, uh, literacy books, teaching plantation workers literacy. You might have a sentence that one sack of cotton weighs
                eighty pounds, another weighs whatever, and the total is 160 pounds. But if we used, used things from the environment. And
                so taking that car to the boardwalk in Atlantic City for everyone to see that this is what the freedom, the three civil
                rights workers were driving, and then you know, you’ve heard that they were murdered. Their bodies were found. And they
                burned this car like this, and people were just, wow. They said, “We can understand why they, this Mississippi segregated
                delegation shouldn’t be seated.”

                And I had seen them at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, uh, as they were leaving to return to Mississippi because they, we
                had gotten this call that the church had burned and Mickey of course would, and James were, would immediately return. And,
                uh, Andy jumped in the car. He was a volunteer. He had not been to Mississippi before. So, uh, we went out to the car and
                told them to be [crosstalk] careful and word came back that they had not been heard from through the WATS line [Wide Area
                Telephone Service, a precursor to 800 numbers that allowed subscribers to make nationwide calls for a flat fee], and, uh, I
                remember in the meeting uh, volunteers were running around full of energy, and then we said, this is very serious, very
                serious. And uh, Herbert Randall captured pictures of me - you may have seen it with my arm out wearing a white blouse, um -
                and he explained to me what happened was I was talking and explaining the seriousness of what was going on that we knew that
                they were dead. And, then I took it outside and continued to talk, and, uh, then he captured a picture of me sitting there
                with my head bowed. We all knew they were dead because you had so many, um, hours or minutes to check in.

                Movement destroyed them. I won’t say the Movement destroyed them, but they were the casualties of the Movement, and we
                don’t talk about them enough. But [clearing throat] but, for, to be eighteen, nineteen, twenty, if you were twenty-five in
                SNCC, you were older, considered old. But to be eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old and you’re exposed to all this danger
                and all of this violence and all of this fear all the time, uh, it’s a wonder that as many people survived as did. It’s

                When it came to burn - uh, attempting to blow our house up, our office up in Natchez. They blew up the wrong house.
                According to the fire chief, I asked him whose house was that, it was ours and they had burned, bombed, threw a Molotov
                cocktail in this, uh, café that belonged to an integrated couple, according to the police chief. He had known them since he
                was a kid. Jake Fishman and his black mistress, and, uh, so we, there were a mob of people there. We got word that our
                office had been blown up and so we ran over there. Every white person in Natchez knew it was going to be blown but us. So
                when we got there, they were standing all around. It’s like in an alley. And we had to go through there and, uh, Mr.
                Archie Curtis the funeral director, was there with his attendant. So we had, felt that we had to go inside and get the names
                of the people who had signed up with us to, on the four-by-four cards, and prior to that John Doar had sent, been sending
                two justice department officials down there, young white guys with sawed off shotguns. They let us see them. They said they
                weren’t coming anymore because, uh, it was getting too dangerous. They would come to check on us every week to see if we
                were alive. And so they weren’t coming back, and this is when they attempted to blow up the office. But to make a long
                story short, we went - Mr. Curtis said, “I’ll take you all in there to get those names and nobody’s going to bother
                you.” And so we went inside. We had to turn the light on and come out. We went through the mob of people and got in the
                car and drove back to Mr. George Metcalf’s boarding house and the phone rang all night until I told this woman who kept
                calling, “Dorie, you M.F. [motherfucker], this and that.” I said, “You know what, Little Richard is coming to the

                I mean split psyche, that Cash, W.J. Cash wrote about in Mind of the South it’s so appropriate here. I remember being in
                Greenwood in spring of sixty, sixty uh, four? Or was it ’63? [19]’63. And, and uh, the police, not the police, but I
                worked in the SNCC office all day that day, and I was one who didn’t mind doing office work. So, uh, and then that night
                left, I left the office about almost midnight, went home, learned that they’d blown up the office that night. Next morning
                got up and found out about it and went in there and cleaned up all the files, retrieved everything possible and I don’t
                think, I mean aside from the momentary danger of it. You say, “Oh that’s horrible.’ But we didn’t skip a beat. You
                know, he next day we were out there again trying to get people to go down to the, going with people down to Greenwood,
                Leflore County, um, courthouse to register to vote. And these police dogs are chasing us and then comes, along comes
                somebody hollering, “Where’s the pay phone? Where’s the pay phone?” I said, “Ask,” um, I said, she said, “I
                want to call the justice department.” And I stopped: “The Justice Department? You want to call the justice
                department?” I didn’t know any black person who knew anyone in the Justice department to call. So I was taken aback. I
                found that more curious than dogs chasing us. So I turned around and it turned out to be Marian Wright [later, Marian Wright
                Edelman] who was at Yale Law School, and she had spent the summer interning at the Justice Department but she was there that
                spring break working with us in Greenwood, voter registration campaign. And I told her about that years later and she said,
                “You know what, I was calling John Doar,” and she said, “You know what he told me, he told me, ‘Calm down. Calm
                down. Tell me what happened.’ And I said, ‘Mister, the dog’s chasing us.’ That was easiest thing to say.”

                I got up and went, cleaned up the files and didn’t really deal with what had just happened emotionally, just didn’t deal
                with it.

                in graduate school, in my apartment. And I just stood there and broke down and started screaming and crying. After all those
                years of, of repressing so much, what I couldn’t understand, because I was always, I never reacted entirely emotional to
                things. I was almost visually filtered through my mind first, in a way. I couldn’t understand how he had lived through the
                worst, the most fearful terror-ridden time of the Movement and then to die after all of the violence, uh, after the most
                violent period. That I couldn’t reconcile.

                And uh, I uh, after listening to Canadian Broadcasting one night in 1992, they were making a movie in Jackson, um, Freedom
                Song. So I, they announced on the radio that, the Canadian Broadcasting, that the archives are open in Jackson, Mississippi
                for black people. That was 1992. They had finished all the slave records and that you could go in and use them. So I took
                the opportunity to go and start doing the research. All of my mother’s re - uh, siblings were alive at that time. They
                lived to be eighty, ninety years old. And I started collecting information, and the more I got into it, it became like a
                disease, which it still is. So, um, to make a long story short, um you know when you’re doing research, people are also
                doing research, the same kind of research, and someone saw that I was researching the same great, great grandfather that,
                uh, this family was. And so, they were approached and said that you may want to know this or may not want to know it. Uh,
                the one in Georgia was approached by a lady in Alabama who is doing her research so she said, I want to know. They had a
                sister in England, so of course we want to know. So I received a letter from England, from London, England saying that we
                may have the same great, great grandfather, and I would like to communicate with you and send photographs, exchange
                photographs, and that’s how it happened. And, uh, we met in Mobile, Alabama. And, uh, we met again in 1998. And we had a
                reunion, two reunions. And we went to the family cemetery where my mother had grown up in Balance, Mississippi, Wayne
                County, and, uh, to look at the cemetery and also to eat. And I spent a great deal of time going into cemeteries looking
                for, uh, Benjamin F. Woulard who was born in 1805 in Rockingham, North Carolina. And we didn’t find him, but we found
                Benjamin Woulard, Jr. who was in the Confederate war. And from the information that both sides get, collected, was that
                Benjamin Woulard had around eleven children - no, thirteen, and -
