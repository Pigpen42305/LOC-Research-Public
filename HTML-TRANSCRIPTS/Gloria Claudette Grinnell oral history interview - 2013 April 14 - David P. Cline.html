                So, if I could ask you, if we could just start with your childhood, if you could tell us a little bit about your family and
                where you were raised and the environment that you came out of.

                Okay. I’ll go back to my grandparents, if I may, because in a way it was a civil rights type activity. My
                grandfather—these are stories that were told to me. And I asked my cousin about it, because he is older than I, and he
                says it’s true. My grandfather had five hundred dollars invested in the stock market and, of course, he lost it. This was
                when people were jumping out the window and so forth.And my grandparents were teachers. I think he taught languages and
                music, and I don’t know what my grandmother taught. But they moved from Virginia to Philadelphia, and that started the
                family—split the family—because my grandparents couldn’t get a job. They said they didn’t hire black teachers in
                Philly. They had black children going to integrated schools, but no black teachers. So, my grandmother took in washing, and
                my grandfather refused to do that type work. And the family actually split. They were together physically but not
                together.The older kids went to college in the family, and they were teachers, the two oldest ones. The youngest kid was
                sent to school by the middle children, who did not go to college. They had to work to help pay. So, [sighs] that again, here
                we go about the color line thing, yeah.

                I was born in D.C. My mother was born in Virginia. My dad was born in Maryland. And when I was three—oh, my parents
                divorced when I was a baby, and my dad took the boy, and my mother took the girl and remarried, moved to San Francisco. So,
                from the age of three on, I grew up in San Francisco. Then, she remarried again and moved to San Diego, and I ended up at
                Virginia Union, yeah, which one of my great-great-grandparents was on the board at Virginia Seminary. And it was great to
                know that my great-great-grandparent had helped to start the school.

                Okay, growing up in San Francisco, I lived in what is now called the West End. It was called Fillmore back in those days.
                It’s where—you know, and I try to think, “Was it full of black people?” I think as a child, you probably don’t
                even know. And I guess that’s where the black people lived.Then, we moved to the Presidio, and I went to St. Dominic’s
                on Pine and Steiner. You know where that is. It was all white. I was the only black child. And every day I used to pray,
                “I hope the nun doesn’t slap me this morning.” She would walk down, as we were praying outside in the morning, and
                slap me. And I would pray to God, “God, I’ve done something wrong. Please help me!” You know, I didn’t know what I
                had done wrong.

                Never did! And I used to get Fs. All my papers were Fs. I was in the second grade or third grade. And my mother said, “You
                need to bring your papers home,” and I started crying. She said, “What’s wrong?” I said, “Mama, I’m dumb. I get
                all Fs.” She said, “That’s okay. Bring them home anyway.”She collected that many papers, about an inch, and marched
                me up to the school. And she says, “Why are these marked wrong? There’s nothing wrong on most of the papers.” I
                didn’t know I was bright.

                smartest girl and I in class were vying for grades. And the nun stopped slapping me. I didn’t tell my mother she slapped
                me.

                So, that was my experience there. I went to a public school first called Presidio. And a little boy said, a little white
                boy, a little boy said that he couldn’t hold my hand because his mother said he couldn’t hold the hand of niggers. So, I
                went home and asked my mother was I a nigger, because I didn’t know. You know? I knew it was something bad—

                Yeah. Yeah. That was my experience there. I had heard of other experiences. I remember we owned a Mom and Pop’s grocery
                store, which is typical in San Francisco. You know, they have Safeway, but generally you have little stores. And a man came
                in. And my parents never talked in front of me, but I heard them whispering that he’s a teacher, but he can only
                substitute because he has a dishonorable discharge, because during World War II he jumped off a ship, refusing to fight,
                because he said why should he fight for America, freeing other countries, when he’s not free here. I remember them saying
                that.

                Yeah. And then, I remember my mother trying to get a job. And they told her, “You join the union first and you can get the
                job.” And the union says, “Get the job first,” and, you know, vice-versa. This went on, and I remember my mother
                crying, but not in front of us. But I do remember. So, little things, subtle things, you know.

                fountain. I said, “Gee, I want a banana split!” I’ll never forget this. “One strawberry, one vanilla, and if you
                don’t have black walnut, please put another strawberry, no chocolate, and strawberry served on top, and whipped cream,”
                and that’s—I’d always get that.The lady went away to make it. And she came back and she says, “Oh, we can’t serve
                you.” And I said, “Oh, are you out?” [Laughs] She says, “No.” And I said, “Oh!” I remember saying, “Oh!
                Oh!” I said, “Oh!” three times. It shocked me. You know, I couldn’t get a banana split because I’m black, sitting
                at the counter.

                “Claudette, I want you to come with me to the Filipino picnic.” I said, “No! I’m not Filipino.” I said, “You
                are.” She says, “Come with me!” So, I went and I took my date. And when we got to the place outside of San Francisco,
                the guy said on the gate, “I have to let you in. Are you sure you want to come?” So, I’ve had that type thing.

                And when I went there, I couldn’t understand why the white people treated the blacks the way they were treated, and why
                the blacks allowed it. I even got angry with some of the black people for not sitting in, the kids. And I didn’t
                understand. I do now. If they had sat in, they wouldn’t have had dinner on the table that night, because their parents
                would have been fired. I had no idea, you know.

                I met a lady at the fiftieth-year reunion. Well, she was in the sit-ins, so evidently I knew her, but I didn’t. They
                needed pictures. I didn’t remember anyone. They needed pictures of when they were young.

                Because I haven’t seen these people in fifty years. And we were sitting at the table, and tears were coming down her eyes.
                I felt like crying, too, but I don’t cry in front of people. And she said that her father was fired, they had to move out
                of state, she had to drop out of school. I don’t know if she ever finished college.And I thought, “You know, that’s
                how naive I was.” She was one of the Virginia people. A few people from Virginia were in the sit-ins. Well, quite a few,
                I’m sure. But I wanted all of them to be in there. But I didn’t live in Virginia. [Laughs] My parents were in
                California, you know.

                to be integration.” You know, it’s not going to—the first thing I did, I remember, when we got arrested, we went to a
                courthouse—I mean, I’m sorry, went to jail. And they put us in this cell, all of us, and it was smelly. And I thought,
                “Doggone it, not even a clean cell can you go in.”And then, in the court, the court was segregated. I felt like, “Am I
                in hell? What has happened?” I mean, even the courts are segregated? And then, I remember a black man came in, and he was
                a drunkard, and you could smell him. And I thought, “Why do the dredges have to come in?” You know, I’m thinking,
                “It’s going downhill fast!” And I thought, “Am I losing my mind?” You know, horrible.

                Not only that, I had to learn black culture. Not that I—you know, I had to learn the black songs. Growing up a
                Catholic—which I’m no longer—growing up a Catholic, you don’t know those songs. I had never heard the “Black
                National Anthem” before in my life. A lot of things I had to learn.I remember I went to—Adam Clayton Powell was a big
                man, and he and my uncle worked together, too. And he came to town to talk. And I went to one of his meetings, civil rights
                meetings. And in the church, the people clapped [claps twice] and they banged their feet like this, and it scared me,
                because I had—well, I don’t want this on the thing.

                going home to San Francisco.” She says, “Claudette, please come back.” She says, “I’ll tell you what. I’ll pay
                your way back, and if you don’t like it, you can go back to D.C., or San Francisco.”Well, I came back and started

                like. Then, I moved to L.A., because I’m partying in L.A. I have friends there. This is during the summertime. I love

                What did that experience that you went through there, both as a student and just experiencing that side of Jim Crow that was
                kind of different from, maybe, from where you were raised, and then going through the sit-ins there and all that, and coming
                back, what did you take away from that? What did you bring back to California?

                That the wheels of justice turn slowly. [Laughs] Really and truly, it’s slowly, you know. And I often thought: Would I do
                it again? Yeah, I would do it again. I would do it again. Yeah.It did hurt me job-wise. I went for a job in D.C., and the
                guy said, “I have to hire you, because you made a high score on the exam. But I don’t think you would be happy here.”
                He says, “I see you’ve been involved in civil rights,” because I always put down that I have an arrest record.And
                then, for LAUSD, I took the written exam ten times, never flunked the written. They flunked me on the T&amp;E, the training
                and experience. So, I was working for the county school district before I came to LAUSD. And I asked the superintendent of
                the county—he liked me as a person—I said, “Mr. [Tolen], can you find out why they won’t hire me in L.A.?” And he
                did. He says, “You have an arrest record for sit-ins, and they think you’re going to be a problem.”And I finally got
                in, because somebody mistakenly sent me a contract. [Laughs] I think it was my guardian angel. I really do. I think somebody
                saw what was happening—I’m just guessing—maybe a black secretary, and sent the paper out.

                come to surface, many of what other people feel have come to surface in a negative fashion. And I don’t like that, you

                Yeah. In fact, I was so angry I wrote a letter, three-page, typewritten, well, computer-written letter. And when I say
                it’s not racial, but it was. We did expulsions for kids who brought knives, guns, drugs, and so forth. Okay, we had a
                hearing, and if we found this to be so, then we told you you were straight-expelled or suspended-expelled, which meant you
                were either kicked out of the school district or you go to a special school.We had a kid who, without any names, of course,
                who was involved and very involved in drugs. But because his parents had money, he was white, they didn’t kick him out.
                And I was so angry! And I was one of three on the committee, and I told the other two committee people, who are white, I
                said, “You know, he’s guilty.” And they said, “Well, he’s going to go to college.” I said, “So?” “Well, we
                judge it on a case by case—.”I said, “Don’t feed that to me! You know, that’s like saying, ‘Oh, you’re so
                good. You can do that.’” I said, “Don’t do that to me.” I said, “The kid is guilty.” So, I wrote a letter
                saying that inner city kids who are not going to go to college who do the same thing or not as much will be expelled.

                kids went to private school. [We did] the French school. But anyway, [laughs] they bused the kids from the school, and no
                parent would put a kid on the bus. They said, “Why should we bus our kids? Our kids have had integrated experiences.
                They’ve gone to Europe. You know, they’ve been to [stores]. They don’t need to go to a white school.” Well, what the
                school district did was take out every other grade.

                in the history books. But she didn’t want to prejudice me against people, which I can appreciate. And I didn’t want to

                they said, “Because when we send the books down South, we tear that page out or we don’t include that page.” I said,
                “But I’ve read the chapter, and it has nothing to do with the chapter.” I said, “You just stuck a black person in

                twenty years. And it was something else to see the sky full of helicopters again. I had forgotten that.

                Not as an expulsion counselor, but before that, I was making home calls as a job in another counselor, PSA, Pupil Services
                [and Attendance], which expulsion was under that, PSA. But it was a different—we had I don’t know how many jobs under
                PSA. I would make home calls, but you learn how to make home calls. You know?

                to eat. We’re going out to eat next Monday, four of us. My neighbor—oh, when I moved in here, my neighbor sent me a pie,
                which I thought was very nice, and another neighbor gave me some fruit. Anyway, my neighbor said, “Oh, I’m from some
                southern state.” And she said it again, to let me know, I think, that, “Hey, I’m okay. I’m a human being,” you
                know, because she told me that.

                have to go into education, social work, the ministry, whatever the jobs were that we could get. If you notice, you ask an
                old person like me, I’m seventy-three, “What did you do?” They’re all in education, because that’s the only thing
                we could do. All the black men were at the post office, you know, with degrees. Today, you can get other jobs, fortunately.

                Washington, I was here. And I told my husband, “Gee, I want to go to the March on Washington!” I really did, you know.
                And my brother would keep me informed. He says, “Claudette, today people are meeting at the White House and planning
                strategy with Kennedy.” I said, “You’re kidding!” He says, “Yeah.” [Pause] So, yeah. [Pause]You know, I’m

                will change their way of thinking, hopefully. Maybe people will get out to vote, if they can, if they don’t
                put—”they,” I keep saying “they,” the parties that be, black or white—put stumbling blocks in the way. You know,
                hopefully. We have so many people that don’t care, [that say], “What difference does my vote make? It’s not going to

                the attorney handling it. That was his friend. And I talked to Attorney Martin. I said, “My uncle told me to talk to
                you.” He said, “Who’s your uncle?” I said, “J. Hugo Madison.” He said, “Oh, I know him!” I said, “He says
                for you to take care of me.” He says, “Okay, I will!” [Laughter]And I felt very happy and giddy about the sit-ins. I
                didn’t—it was depressing, as I said, the whole thing of being in that paddy wagon. It was not clean. And then, being in
                the jail wasn’t clean. And then, the courtroom was segregated, and it was smelly. And the guy who came in was nasty and
                smelly. I just thought, “I’m losing my mind! This is hell!” I really thought I was—I didn’t know what hell was at
                that time. [Laughs] Yeah.

                And he was a Baptist minister, and at that time I was a pseudo-Catholic. I went to Catholic church in Richmond, and I knelt
                down. And everyone came in the pew. They looked over and saw me and got up and left. I said, “Now, my faith is not that
                good to start out with, and you guys are not helping it any,” I’m thinking, you know. And this—people are going to
                hate me when I say this, because I’m spiritual now, whatever that means.So, I told the priest after Mass, I said, “You
                know, people came in”—when I say “people,” white people—“people came in the pew where I was, and they looked
                over and saw me and got up and left.” I said, “Then, an old lady came. There was no place to sit, and she came late and
                saw me. She knelt down beside me, then she saw me and got up and left.” He says, “My child, pray for her.” And I
                thought, “Well, I’m not going to church anymore. I have to pray for people? And you can’t tell them, you know, during
                a Mass?”

                He was nice. I would go with him when he preached down in the country. He had to do like an intern preaching at these
                country churches. And he used to say, “[Darn], you Catholic girl.” He would call me a Catholic girl. We were—when I
                say boyfriend-girlfriend, we weren’t tight, tight, tight, but we were boyfriend-girlfriend.

                a Greyhound bus line that the courts had already said it should be not separate but equal, together, and they did not
                integrate it. It was in Virginia. And my aunt told my mother—my mother was visiting. My aunt told my mother and another
                sister, “Come on, we’re going to go to D.C. from Virginia, and we’re going by bus.” And my mother says, “Why?
                Let’s drive!” And my aunt said, “No, we’re going by bus.” Mama says, “We don’t want to take the
                Greyhound.”Anyway, they took the Greyhound. And my aunt got off and says, “You keep going to D.C. Call Hugo—that’s
                my uncle—and call Powell, Adam Clayton Powell, because I’m going to get arrested.” And she did, because she sat in the

                But I write good letters, too, to compliment people, when they should be. I fell. I was riding my bicycle and I turned a
                corner too fast. And, for the first time, I didn’t have my helmet on, and I hit my head on the fire hydrant around the
                corner.

                And I’m down there crying like an ugly thing, just crying, and I look uglier than ugly when I cry. And two men got out of
                their truck. They said, “Are you okay?” And I said [speaking as though she’s crying], “[inaudible].” And I’m
                crying, crying. One man held my hand. Then, I thought, “Oh, God! You’re looking ugly. Stop crying!” So, I stopped
                crying. [Laughs] But, you know, they were two white men helping a black lady, or two men helping a female, for that matter,
                you know. So, I haven’t felt anything in a while. I mean, I’m sure—as I said, if I feel anything, I move on. You
                know?

                Um-hmm. It might be wrapping up here. I feel—but do you think about that, you know, what you did at Virginia Union and
                being part of those protests, as something very historic that you did, of being a participant in this Movement?

                I do now. I didn’t think it was. I thought it was something we were doing, and I was one of many people across the
                country. But I didn’t realize it until afterwards. In fact, I didn’t realize it until I was at a school. And I was in
                the library, and the lady says, “Dr. Grinnell, do you know anything about the Civil Rights Movement?” And I said,
                “Yeah, I do.” I said, “I was in it.” She says, “You were?” I thought, “It’s not a big deal.” You know?
                Then I realized, “She’s young. She’s a young teacher.” And that’s when it hit me: I guess it was a big deal. You
                know?
