                    I can’t say that it was better, because we always had a good life. We had what we needed. We was always full. We had the
                    clothing that we needed, because my mother was a good seamstress. So, she sewed, she made our clothing. I can’t say it was
                    any better when we moved there than when we were on the farm. It’s just that I didn’t have to do the farm work.

                    Oh, feed the chickens or milk the cow, which I was afraid of. Sometimes I had to pick cotton; wasn’t very good at that.
                    So, I really—really, to be perfectly honest with you, I didn’t do too much on the farm. But what—the little bit I did

                    Well, it was an experience being in high school. I met a lot of other people that I didn’t know. It was cold most of the
                    time, with one heater in the classroom. You’d sit in the classroom with your heavy coats on in order to stay warm. There
                    was no lunchroom, so you had to carry your lunch. If you had a lunch, you had to take your lunch from home.Well,
                    it—[sighs] it wasn’t what it should have been. We didn’t have the equipment that we needed. There were two classes,
                    and there was a divider between the two classrooms. So, when we had—and it was used for an auditorium. Whenever we had
                    some type of program, they had to remove the petition from between the two classrooms. And you could hear what was going on
                    in the other classroom, so it was kind of—sometimes it would be kind of noisy.

                    Tenth grade. Now, you know, the famous Brown ruling, saying that segregation in education is unconstitutional, had been
                    passed two years earlier. Was there any talk about desegregating schools at that time while you were in school?

                    No, because at that time, black people seemed to have been afraid to really discuss stuff like that. If my memory serves me
                    right, there was a certain amount of information that you could get from government. They were—the black teachers, I
                    think, were told what to teach. So, you know, we didn’t know too much about government and things of that nature.

                    My parents didn’t know too much about segregation or, you know, about in the schools. But they knew that we didn’t have
                    what we needed in order to be properly educated. The books were—pages were torn out. We were getting them from the white
                    school. When they got new books, they would pass the old ones down to us. There would be writings all over the books and
                    pages—part of the pages were torn out. Sometimes we would have one spelling book to a class. The teacher would have to put
                    the words on the board, and you would have to write them off, because we didn’t have enough books.

                    There was a lady, her name was Carolyn Daniels, and they would stay at her house. If I’m not mistaken, Lucius Holloway
                    would have some boarding at his house. Nobody ever stayed with us, but my mother would make cakes and things like that for
                    them, try to help to feed them.

                    Yes. Myself and some of the students from the high school—Gladys Clark, who is now deceased, and her sister, Annie Dean
                    Clark—we would canvas the areas in Dawson in the evenings after school, going from door to door. The people would run in
                    the house when they would see us coming. “Here come the Freedom Riders!” That’s what they called us. And they would go
                    in the house and close their door. They were afraid to talk to us.

                    We would talk to them about becoming registered voters and try to encourage them to come to the meetings so they could hear
                    and see what was going on. But they were afraid of losing their jobs or being made to move out of the homes that they were
                    living in, because they would be renting. And they would just tell us, “I’m afraid I’ll get fired or I’ll have to

                    Um-hmm. I want to go back to late summer of ’62. You had been involved with the Terrell County Movement, and mass meetings
                    were being held at Mount Olive, the family church. And then, in August, the church is burned.

                    It was like a death, that someone you loved had died. Sad to think that people would be so mean that they would burn a
                    church. It didn’t stop anything. It just made us more determined. How could you burn the house of God because people would
                    want to register to vote? That’s what happened.

                    If I’m not mistaken, we went to the Methodist church. It was a small church in Sasser. They became afraid that they were
                    going to burn their church, so they stopped us from doing that.So, by this time, they had started a foundation to rebuild
                    Mount Olive. We would put chairs there, and so they told us we could not do that. So, then they brought in a big tent and
                    they put it in the back. And we held our Sunday services and our meetings in that tent.

                    Sad. Everybody—it was just—it was a sad day. As I said, it was just like a death, because that church had always been
                    there. It had always been a part of that little city and Terrell County.

                    Yes, because the word was out that anyone who participated in the meetings, and they owned their own home, they was going to

                    Yes, not—in my opinion, not to try and find out who did what, but basically, I think, just to cover themselves. But when
                    the Justice Department came down, a lot of things started happening. They were taking statements from different people, and
                    they took that back to Washington with them. The little book that I had that I kept notes in, they took it back. I never got
                    it back.

                    Because it was. It was just—[pause] I never run into, really, when I was growing up, a whole lot of prejudice from the
                    people, because our parents protected us from that. We never worked in white folks’ houses or went places of that nature.
                    We were always protected from that. So, some of the stuff that some people experienced, we never did. My worst experience
                    was when I started working with the Movement.

                    Yeah, when I started working with the Movement. Other than that, when I was a child, I didn’t know. I knew that things
                    they had was better than what I had, especially with the school. We had to walk to school, and they rode the school bus.
                    They had better books. So, that was really basically all. And certain places that they could go that I couldn’t go, but
                    then, they had the places for the blacks. So, in a way, I felt like that was the way, kindly the way it was supposed to be.
                    I still had some place to go. I may not have been able to go where they went, but we still had places to go.

                    So, did—when you joined—when you’re active in the Movement, and now you’re encountering and experiencing these white
                    folk in this sort of different way, did that change what you thought about them?

                    I’m seeing now what I’ve been missing. You know, you couldn’t go into a restaurant and sit down and eat. If you went
                    to get a hamburger, you had to get it through a hole in the wall, because you couldn’t go inside. So, it kind of opened my
                    eyes into what was really going on.

                    It made me determined to try to make things better for everybody, not just black people, but for everybody, because you
                    can’t help one unless you help the other. There were poor white people living in that area was, I would say, just as poor
                    as I was, or poorer. So, you can’t help one race of people unless you help the other race.

                    Kind of slowed down a bit. When people started becoming registered voters, things kind of—the canvasing kind of slowed
                    down a bit. Most of it was done when people were running for election. We started canvasing the area, trying to support this
                    person or support that person, get people out to the polls, make sure that nobody kept them from voting.And it
                    just—somewhere in there, [pause] I stopped. I went home to take care of my sister’s baby. She had a child and she was
                    working. She needed somebody to keep her, so my parents brought me home. So, that’s what I was doing. Then, later on, I

                    I—you know, I don’t know how to put this, but things are better on the surface. They look good, but there’s a lot that
                    still needs to be worked on. You know how stuff is under the cover? And you see the smiles and the handshakes and—but
                    everything is not coming up roses, and I don’t think it ever will be. So, what you have to do is just—you do the best
                    you can to make life for you and your family and other people around you as comfortable as possible. You do what you can.I
                    don’t think we, as black people, are going to ever be where God intended for us to be, because there are people who are
                    working every day to keep it from happening. We have a black president, and they’re blocking him at every move he makes.
                    So, if he can’t make things better, they won’t let him, what do you think about me? They’re not going to listen to me
                    either, but I try.
