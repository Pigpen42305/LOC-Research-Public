                I can’t say that it was better, because we always had a good life. We had what we needed. We was always full. We had the
                clothing that we needed, because my mother was a good seamstress. So, she sewed, she made our clothing. I can’t say it was
                any better when we moved there than when we were on the farm. It’s just that I didn’t have to do the farm work.

                Oh, feed the chickens or milk the cow, which I was afraid of. Sometimes I had to pick cotton; wasn’t very good at that.
                So, I really—really, to be perfectly honest with you, I didn’t do too much on the farm. But what—the little bit I did
                do, I wasn’t too happy about.

                Well, it was an experience being in high school. I met a lot of other people that I didn’t know. It was cold most of the
                time, with one heater in the classroom. You’d sit in the classroom with your heavy coats on in order to stay warm. There
                was no lunchroom, so you had to carry your lunch. If you had a lunch, you had to take your lunch from home.Well,
                it—[sighs] it wasn’t what it should have been. We didn’t have the equipment that we needed. There were two classes,
                and there was a divider between the two classrooms. So, when we had—and it was used for an auditorium. Whenever we had
                some type of program, they had to remove the petition from between the two classrooms. And you could hear what was going on
                in the other classroom, so it was kind of—sometimes it would be kind of noisy.

                Tenth grade. Now, you know, the famous Brown ruling, saying that segregation in education is unconstitutional, had been

                No, because at that time, black people seemed to have been afraid to really discuss stuff like that. If my memory serves me
                right, there was a certain amount of information that you could get from government. They were—the black teachers, I
                think, were told what to teach. So, you know, we didn’t know too much about government and things of that nature.

                My parents didn’t know too much about segregation or, you know, about in the schools. But they knew that we didn’t have
                what we needed in order to be properly educated. The books were—pages were torn out. We were getting them from the white
                school. When they got new books, they would pass the old ones down to us. There would be writings all over the books and
                pages—part of the pages were torn out. Sometimes we would have one spelling book to a class. The teacher would have to put
                the words on the board, and you would have to write them off, because we didn’t have enough books.

                in Terrell County. All I need her to do is to do what I ask her to do, and I pay her.”

                that it was done. You know, “I have a right to become a registered voter. This is my God-given right. So, why should you
                take it away from me?” But that’s what happened.

                Yes. And then, from time to time, the police would pay us a visit. The sheriff and his deputies would come and they would
                put their feet on the seats and just talk, be ugly, really ugly. “We’re sick of all this mess,” they would say. “Our

                about them looking up to me. But we all had the same goal as to help black people get what they were supposed to have, what
                had been taken away from us. That was our goal: to become decent citizens, first-class citizens.

                We would just go into a restaurant. There was a restaurant in Dawson. I can’t think of the name of it. And he would tell
                us what we were supposed to do before we went in. He said we would just go and just sit at the counter or just sit down. He
                said, “And if they say something, we’ll just leave.” And that’s what we would do. He said, “I don’t want anybody
                to get in trouble or anybody to get hit or anything.” So, he was sort of our protector.

                learned to do this! And all of their lives, they hadn’t been able to do it!

                Um-hmm. I want to go back to late summer of ’62. You had been involved with the Terrell County Movement, and mass meetings
                were being held at Mount Olive, the family church. And then, in August, the church is burned.

                It was like a death, that someone you loved had died. Sad to think that people would be so mean that they would burn a
                church. It didn’t stop anything. It just made us more determined. How could you burn the house of God because people would
                want to register to vote? That’s what happened.

                If I’m not mistaken, we went to the Methodist church. It was a small church in Sasser. They became afraid that they were
                going to burn their church, so they stopped us from doing that.So, by this time, they had started a foundation to rebuild
                Mount Olive. We would put chairs there, and so they told us we could not do that. So, then they brought in a big tent and
                they put it in the back. And we held our Sunday services and our meetings in that tent.

                the Justice Department came down, a lot of things started happening. They were taking statements from different people, and
                they took that back to Washington with them. The little book that I had that I kept notes in, they took it back. I never got
                it back.

                Because it was. It was just—[pause] I never run into, really, when I was growing up, a whole lot of prejudice from the
                people, because our parents protected us from that. We never worked in white folks’ houses or went places of that nature.
                We were always protected from that. So, some of the stuff that some people experienced, we never did. My worst experience
                was when I started working with the Movement.

                Yeah, when I started working with the Movement. Other than that, when I was a child, I didn’t know. I knew that things
                they had was better than what I had, especially with the school. We had to walk to school, and they rode the school bus.
                They had better books. So, that was really basically all. And certain places that they could go that I couldn’t go, but
                then, they had the places for the blacks. So, in a way, I felt like that was the way, kindly the way it was supposed to be.
                I still had some place to go. I may not have been able to go where they went, but we still had places to go.

                So, did—when you joined—when you’re active in the Movement, and now you’re encountering and experiencing these white
                folk in this sort of different way, did that change what you thought about them?

                I’m seeing now what I’ve been missing. You know, you couldn’t go into a restaurant and sit down and eat. If you went
                to get a hamburger, you had to get it through a hole in the wall, because you couldn’t go inside. So, it kind of opened my
                eyes into what was really going on.

                It made me determined to try to make things better for everybody, not just black people, but for everybody, because you
                can’t help one unless you help the other. There were poor white people living in that area was, I would say, just as poor
                as I was, or poorer. So, you can’t help one race of people unless you help the other race.

                Kind of slowed down a bit. When people started becoming registered voters, things kind of—the canvasing kind of slowed
                down a bit. Most of it was done when people were running for election. We started canvasing the area, trying to support this
                person or support that person, get people out to the polls, make sure that nobody kept them from voting.And it
                just—somewhere in there, [pause] I stopped. I went home to take care of my sister’s baby. She had a child and she was
                working. She needed somebody to keep her, so my parents brought me home. So, that’s what I was doing. Then, later on, I
                got married and I moved away.

                white water fountains, the signs were down. It was kind of strange, you know. It had changed a lot. And you could go into
                any restaurant you wanted to, sit down and eat. You could go to a movie, and you didn’t have to sit in the balcony, and
                sit down on the lower level and have people throw things down on you. So, it was a whole lot different.

                ’90s?

                So, that’s one of the things that didn’t change, would you say—this idea that, you know, there were people who were
                opposed to change?

                I—you know, I don’t know how to put this, but things are better on the surface. They look good, but there’s a lot that
                still needs to be worked on. You know how stuff is under the cover? And you see the smiles and the handshakes and—but
                everything is not coming up roses, and I don’t think it ever will be. So, what you have to do is just—you do the best
                you can to make life for you and your family and other people around you as comfortable as possible. You do what you can.I
                don’t think we, as black people, are going to ever be where God intended for us to be, because there are people who are
                working every day to keep it from happening. We have a black president, and they’re blocking him at every move he makes.
                So, if he can’t make things better, they won’t let him, what do you think about me? They’re not going to listen to me
                either, but I try.

                We’ve covered a lot, but I know there’s so much more that we could possibly talk about. Is there anything that you want
                to add that perhaps we didn’t talk about, or you want to say a little more about?

                Just to ask our people to become more active in voting, registering to vote, and voting after you register. Support your
                elected officials in whatever they’re doing, because it’s for your benefit. We put them in office, and then, we’re
                hands-off. They need to be held accountable. And if we don’t do it, who’s going to?
