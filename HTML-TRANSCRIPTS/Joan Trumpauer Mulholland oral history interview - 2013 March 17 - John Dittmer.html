                    well through the fifties, and then switched to the Department of State, but doing pretty much the same thing. And my mother
                    had worked as a secretary and became a stay-at-home mom, as was the custom. She came from rural Georgia.

                    In the forties. Well, Arlington was definitely the South, maybe not the Deep South, but everything by law and custom was

                    Church was a big part of my life. I was Presbyterian, because where my dad grew up, it was a Swedish town, and the Lutheran
                    church, which would have been the natural, was in Swedish.

                    So, I went to the Presbyterian church that was nearby. And we memorized all these Bible verses and got our gold star if we
                    could recite it. You know, “Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, you have done it
                    unto me,” “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, for such is the Kingdom of God,” all that stuff. And
                    sang those songs about “Jesus loves the little children, red and yellow, black and white.”But the church was segregated
                    by law and, of course, as soon as we left the church, we were—continued to be hypocrites.

                    Not that I remember so openly. But I was always going to the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship. And one Sunday, we were told
                    that next Sunday there would be some colored students coming to meet with us, but we were to keep this absolutely quiet.

                    We were not to tell our parents, our friends, anybody. And the reasons being that the American Nazi Party was around the
                    corner, their headquarters, and of course, it was illegal, so the police could come. And some of the church—I don’t know
                    if “elders” is the word in the Presbyterians, but church leaders might be against this and lock us out and fire the
                    minister forthwith. So, we kept it quiet. And I guess at least twice this same group of students, organized through the
                    black Y, came and had our standard spaghetti dinner with us. And I don’t remember what we talked about, particularly, but
                    this was in the throes of the county wanting to go along with Brown versus Board, and the state of Virginia in the throes of
                    massive resistance. This would have been the late fifties. So, I think a lot of it was so that a few students would know
                    each other across racial lines when it came. And I stayed in touch with one of the girls for a while.

                    Years later, I tried to track this down a bit and I—to get back to that. It was a county gathering at the school that was
                    the first integrated. And I raised the question: Did anybody—could anybody fill me in on how this was organized? Did the
                    white ministers reach out? Did the black community reach out to the white ministers? Was this happening all over the county,
                    and we just didn’t know about it?Nobody knew a thing. One woman said she thought if anyone knew, it would be her mother,
                    who was ill and could not make it that night, and she would ask her. But a week later her mother was dead.

                    something that they would never forget and made them realize how vulnerable they were and how rotten the system was, if they

                    So, the concept of lynching was not shocking, because there would always be these big debates as to whether Leo Frank was
                    innocent or guilty. And the lynch mob had gone by my aunt’s house, as I understood.

                    Well, I think, you know, going back to this memorizing the Bible verses, and then, we had the Declaration of Independence in
                    high school. We had to memorize it. And once, when I was down at Grandma’s—I must have been about ten—this girl that I
                    used to hang out with, sort of dared each other to go walk through “Nigger Town,” we called it, and just the striking
                    disparity. Of course, everyone just sort of evaporated as we—saw these two white girls coming down the road. But I could
                    see with my own eyes the difference between the black school and the white school that was a new brick building and all
                    that. And that really struck me.And then, in high school, the girl next to me in Spanish class had been in one of those
                    jurisdictions in Virginia where the schools were closed. So, instead of enjoying her senior year, she was sent to live with
                    relatives or somebody and doing eleventh grade a year late. And just seeing the effect of segregation and knowing the
                    hypocrisy of it from what our founding documents and the Bible, I just sort of felt, as a Southerner, that we needed to
                    change. And when I had my chance to help do something, I would seize it.

                    You’re anticipating my next question, and that is a broader question that Southerners were the first white people to seek
                    out the young black activists in SNCC and CORE—talking about people like you, Bob Zellner, Casey Hayden. Why do you think
                    it was white Southerners who were first in the Movement rather than Northerners?

                    Because those Yankees up there were looking down their nose at us. [Laughter] And, well, we were at home. We were working at
                    home on what we saw as our own problems. You know, think globally, act locally; bloom where you’re planted. Those things
                    came in later. But back then, we were very local-oriented, particularly in the South. We had to be able to place people,
                    know where you were from, who you were related to, very community-minded. A trip to the next state was a big deal; for some
                    people, to the next county. And so, I think it was natural, between our community orientation and our deep religious
                    convictions.

                    It was some small church school in the North, I think, maybe Ohio. But I had gone to such a massive high school that it was
                    just totally overcrowded with growing suburbia in the fifties that I wanted a small place where you were known, for better
                    or worse, but not where you were lost in the mob. And Mother was afraid of integration, a product of her environment, and

                    So, I went to Duke. But it was there, after the sit-ins got going in Durham, that our Presbyterian chaplain—and I was
                    going to their Sunday evening meetings—told us, and it was like déjà vu, that some students from North Carolina College
                    who were doing the sit-ins would be coming over next week. “Don’t spread the word unless it’s somebody you think would
                    really want to come, because the administration could lock us out, the police could show up, or the local rowdies could
                    visit us.” And these well-dressed, well-spoken students came over and explained all about the sit-ins, legally and
                    morally, and at the end, invited us to join them.

                    meant you got dressed up and went and sat and got picked over by these girls that you didn’t know to see if you were
                    suitable for an organization that you really didn’t know either, and it cost money. And the International Club, which was
                    basically graduate school guys, was having a potluck party the same night. And we thought, “Oh, graduate guys! This sounds
                    much better!” [Laughter] So, we went to that.Well, my lands! Typically, Duke rather got upset with this. They sent

                    Well, they invited us to join. And a few graduate guys and Lucia and I—fortunately we were roommates—went down and got
                    on the picket lines. And when it came time for a sit-in, which wasn’t too long into it, we joined them at the lunch
                    counter. I don’t have strong memories of it now, you know, the details, but twice in jail, and it was—

                    Um-hmm. And I don’t remember if the whites sat down first or not, but there weren’t that many whites. So, I suspect we

                    I don’t remember, but generally you were asked to leave. But, in jail, the whites were —that’s where it had its
                    potential for being scary, that you were in with the regular white prisoners, or by yourself—

                    And you didn’t know what would happen. I think some of the guys were roughed up. Well, one of my favorite moments comes
                    out of that. When, after we got out of jail and we were talking about it with the black students, they had had a pretty good
                    time, because Durham was not the Deep South. They had made the most of it.And once they realized that the white students
                    didn’t have quite such a good time, they came up with a plan. An awful lot of us had Native American ancestry, or claimed
                    to, black and white. So, North Carolina state law—someone checked it—provided for separate cells for white men, white
                    women, colored men, colored women, and “others.” Didn’t say anything about men others and women others, just
                    “others.” And so, we decided we would all be “others,” get arrested on Friday, refuse bail, insist on being locked
                    up together in one cell, and party all weekend! [Laughter] And make bail Monday morning to get to class!

                    The other moment from that: I understand we would have been expelled. The administration at Duke wanted to kick us out and
                    called us over to the Dean’s Office when we got back from jail. There was a note in our mailbox saying to call the dean,
                    and she wanted us to report to her office, which was—by now, it’s after dark, and it’s the only light on in the
                    building. You know, I had to walk over to this administrative building. And we came in, and she locked the door and put the
                    key in her pocket.And we had quite a little discussion. And had we called our parents? Well, of course, neither one of us
                    had, Lucia and me. So, “There’s the phone.” And obviously we weren’t getting out, since she had the key in her
                    pocket, until we made the phone call. And I’ve understood since then that we would have been expelled except the
                    professional organization for the professors and, you know, their associates—

                    Oh, yeah, lots of tensions. And I don’t think things really got on anything like a normal footing—never really normal
                    but, you know, like it—until the grandkids came along.

                    was a summer temp, that I had had making money to go to college, down at the FCC. And that ran out, and then I ended up
                    getting a job with some Wisconsin senator, just very menial office work, and then Senator Engle eventually. But I had joined
                    up with the Howard group, Nonviolent Action Group.

                    Well, when I left, was leaving North Carolina, some of the students at NCC said, “Well, now, we haven’t heard anything
                    from Howard since the founding meeting of SNCC at Shaw at Easter break. And we haven’t heard anything from them! So, when
                    you get up there, go up to Howard and find out what’s happening. And if they’re not doing anything, get something
                    going!” [Laughter] Well, of course, I had no clue where Howard really was, growing up in Arlington. But I got there and
                    was walking around campus, looking lost and asking people, stopping them, if they knew anybody who was involved with student
                    demonstrations or sit-ins or what-have-you. And I understand that they had been having sympathy pickets at, say, downtown
                    Woolworth’s and things like that. But there was a meeting planned that night or the next, or something, to talk about
                    sit-ins. They were planning, as it turned out, to go to Arlington, because I think some diplomatic sorts had been denied
                    service.Well, I was from Arlington. I had a little experience with sit-ins and jails, so I was welcomed into the group. Now,
                    it wasn’t just students at Howard University. It was people from the community, some with CORE affiliations and
                    what-have-you and possibly, I think, other universities in town. And so, we went out to Arlington and sat in, and the
                    American Nazi Party showed up. And went to the local high school and encouraged kids getting out of school to come up where
                    we were sitting down in Cherrydale. And—

                    I have a whole list of them upstairs. Somebody who is writing a book just asked who was at those counters, and I got out the
                    old clippings and wrote down all the names about a month ago. I think there were about 13 of us, 12 or 13, the first day. We
                    sat at one place, I think the Drug Fair, which is now gone, and then we—some moved down to Peoples. I mean, they closed
                    the counters, but did not ask the police to arrest us or anything. But crowds were coming in, because school was letting
                    out.I really think, though I haven’t researched this or know, that these were local chains, locally owned, Peoples and
                    Drug Fair, probably with these same sort of liberal New York Jewish connections, the founder or the owners—particularly
                    Drug Fair, I know was—and that they were not going to break the state law by integrating. They were sort of waiting to be

                    And after about a week of demonstrations—including down at Woolworth’s in Arlington right near where we ate, and we had

                    Glen Echo was a Disney of its day. It was an amusement park, and it was where white Washington went for summer fun, and of
                    course segregated. And the—it was at Bannockburn community, which was sort of a coop community of the same sort of Jews
                    who had lived in Buckingham and then, after World War II, were buying, wanting housing. And, of course, there were
                    restrictive covenants in a lot of the housing, so they started this community over near Glen Echo in Maryland.And they had
                    been pushing the county—Montgomery County was sending, in the summer programs, the white kids to swim at Glen Echo and the
                    black kids into D.C., and they wanted everyone to go to the same place: Glen Echo. So, they had been petitioning the county
                    or, you know, starting to raise a ruckus on this, and I don’t know how much some of the folks in NAG may have been aware
                    of this. But, anyway, we all ended up at the same place. And I and maybe some other folks could, of course, buy tickets. You
                    had tickets, and if you wanted to ride, you gave a ticket for the ride. And I went and bought a whole bunch of tickets and
                    handed them over to the black students, who then could go zooming through the arch and down to the merry-go-round or
                    whatever and get arrested on the merry-go-round, which of course doesn’t have a back way out.And this later got into the
                    whole issue, as I understand it, of private security guards or whatever being used to enforce the state law or whatever, but
                    the use of private guards in making an arrest on this. And so, after they were arrested, it became a summer-long picket,
                    with strong support from the Bannockburn community with union-made signs, and sandwiches, and picking us up on hot days and
                    taking us over to their homes for a little R&amp;R and lemonade and pit stops. And the American Nazi Party was out again.

                    Yes, George Lincoln Rockwell. He made it to the lunch counters in Arlington with swastikas, and he made it to Glen Echo,
                    which was—got a little tense, because you had folks from the World War II concentration camps with numbers on their arms.
                    So, the police required certain degrees of separation. So, you had pickets and counter-pickets and occasionally somebody
                    driving by the road there and yelling something or throwing a little something. But basically it was this pretty long
                    peaceful summer of picketing.

                    line. And I think we went as far as Hagerstown, maybe, and out toward the Eastern Shore. And then, with the jail-in in Rock
                    Hill, South Carolina, the call went out to come down and join them.

                    heard that I was arrested, but I think I was just—I don’t even remember being booked. I may have been booked, but I
                    think it may have been more of a protective custody, “we’re taking you in,” type of thing. There was never any trial
                    or what-have-you.

                    Now, the thing that’s interesting to me about Rock Hill, and this diverges a little bit from me, but to draw the
                    connection: Diane Nash of the Nashville Movement is one of the people who had answered the call. And this was like in
                    February or something, January or February, I’d have to check. But in December, the Supreme Court had made a ruling on the
                    facilities in interstate commerce.Diane was in the jail, stayed the sentence. Tom Gaither was down there from CORE. Leaving
                    Rock Hill after the jail-in, Tom and I think Cary on a Greyhound bus started talking about doing something to test the
                    Supreme Court ruling, and the whole idea of the Freedom Ride was formed. SNCC had its April meeting in Charlotte and
                    referred back to the Supreme Court decision and called for students to test the ruling, not necessarily get arrested in a
                    strange town, but see if it’s being enforced.Well, you had this SNCC thing that came out in April, Diane had just been in
                    the jail-in, so when all hell broke loose in May in Alabama, things were primed from two directions for the student
                    movement, the kids who had been in the Deep South, in the South with the sit-ins, to continue. It was just like you had been
                    priming it.

                    Oh, yeah. Paul Dietrich, who was one of our leaders—it was the restaurant that he was manager, at the Chinese restaurant
                    where they had the last supper. Hank Thomas was one of the original 13. And, of course, John Lewis was involved in this. So,
                    he was a SNCC person. So, we were, you know, well aware of it. So, when the bus was burned in Aniston, and there was the
                    picture of Hank standing outside the burning bus, NAG was just as quick out of the shoot as Nashville, but Nashville was
                    closer to Alabama.

                    So, they got there first. But, I mean, three of our guys left right away: Paul, John Moody, and Dion Diamond. But by the
                    time they could get down there without all the interstates, things had moved to Montgomery. And they were trapped in that
                    church that was surrounded by everyone and the tear gas and all that. And Paul called me from the basement of the church
                    when you had like a minute or two to call. He knew I was in an efficiency apartment, and the phone was very close to the
                    bed. That was better to call that than, say, a dormitory at Howard, where you’d have to go wandering around, and your two
                    minutes would be up. And it was just, “We’re trapped in the church. I can’t talk, but send more people.” And we
                    started sending more.[Recording stops and then resumes]

                    So, on May 4, 1961, thirteen Freedom Riders leave Washington on a bus tour of the South to test the Supreme Court ruling. A
                    month later, you are arrested in Jackson, Mississippi. We were just talking about your getting the phone call from the
                    church in Montgomery that was surrounded, saying, “Send more people.” What happened next?

                    Well, we started trying to get folks from NAG to see who could go and filtering them in, two or three at a time. Actually,
                    NAG ended up sending second only to Nashville in numbers of the students in the Southern Student Movement, so we were right
                    there, just further. So, by the time I went, things had gotten very routine. The Kennedys had struck their bargain with the
                    power structure. You came into Jackson—

                    The deal was the Kennedys didn’t like the bad PR worldwide, and Kennedy and Khrushchev were going to be do-si-do-ing. And
                    it was bad press, and they wanted that stopped. Mississippi wanted to arrest those outside agitators. So, Mississippi agreed
                    there would be no violence like Alabama, but they could arrest people on a local charge. So, we were charged with breach of
                    peace, meaning we made other people feel like beating us up. [Laughter]So, you got off the train, you got off the bus,
                    whatever. Captain Ray would arrest you. “Y’all move on! Move out! Did you hear me? You gonna do it? You’re under
                    arrest!” And then, you got in the paddy wagon. And it had gotten down, scripted, by the time I got down there.

                    segregated. And the women’s cell, white women’s cell, where I was, before we were taken to Parchman, it had gotten so
                    crowded that if you don’t count the space taken up by the shower stall or the bunks, we had less than three square feet of
                    floor space per person.

                    culturally in common with the black girls in the next cell, who were Southerners.

                    I met on a trip somewhere in the Arctic, I would say probably off Baffin Island, on a ship, some women from Jackson, just by
                    chance. It was open seating for the meals, and we sat, and, “Oh, where are you from?” Da-dee-da-dee-da. And I had been
                    in Mississippi. “Oh, where in Mississippi?” “Tougaloo.” And did I know anything about the Civil Rights Movement?
                    “Yeah.”But these two elderly women were saying that back in that time, they kept telling the people at their church that
                    these folks are not violent, they’re not really breaking the law. You know, they were very supportive verbally. And how
                    much they may have done under the cover I don’t know, but it was so nice for them to hear that what they had been saying
                    was true.

                    upping it. I was sort of at the medium level, and then, before long, it was up to six months, five hundred dollars, which

                    But when they actually took us, they didn’t say where we were going. We were loaded into the back of a—I guess it was a
                    paddy wagon or a truck-like paddy wagon thing, and taken up. Now, I knew, just intellectually—I had heard of Parchman,
                    that it was bad, but the full horror of it had not reached northern Virginia. Angola you heard more about, at least up
                    here.But the scary part of the ride, aside from not knowing where you’re going—and some of the other girls had heard
                    more about Parchman than I had—was when the driver turned off the road. And this was before interstates; this was a
                    two-lane. And he turned off, went back a bit where there was this house, and these guys were coming and looking in on us.We
                    didn’t know what was going to happen. Some of us thought we’d get killed. In retrospect, he probably needed a pit stop
                    [laughter] and was seizing the moment at a friend’s house. But anything could have happened and, you know, things like
                    that did happen.

                    Went through the gates. Basically stripped. They gave us of course black and white striped skirts and, I think, a tee-shirt
                    for a top and took our stuff and bagged it and even gave most of it back at the end. And then, we had the vaginal exam,

                    We were put in a—well, the cells were segregated. But it’s this one cell block, so it’s just one side of the wing. But
                    it could be a white cell, a black cell, a black cell, a white cell.

                    You had communication but you didn’t see people. You knew voices, perhaps. And, actually, it was at the Freedom Rider
                    reunion thing that I met this one woman, Helen Singleton, from California, and she remembered my voice and name, but she had
                    no idea what I looked like.

                    And it was like, “Oh, wow!” This was a great moment. But if you—you would go down the cellblock for a shower, but the

                    didn’t really get to see people and connect a face with a voice and name. So, we were in the cellblock, not really having
                    any mental image of the prison farm beyond our cellblock. We knew it was death row, but we didn’t know exactly where the
                    death chamber was.

                    They cleaned out death row, emptied it out. And it was much cleaner, and the food was a lot better, and we had a lot more

                    In—you know, physically, it was a step up. But in Hinds County, you could scream bloody murder or you could even sing as a
                    group, and they could hear you on the streets of Jackson. Here, as they pointed out to us, no reporters are coming to get
                    you. So, the psychological component, after you go through this little exam, and then you’re in complete isolation and at
                    their mercy, really played on a lot of minds.

                    And Mississippi had not been celebrating the Fourth of July for that long because Vicksburg had fallen on the Fourth, plus
                    the fireworks never got down there in time anyway, leading to a great New Year’s.

                    Yes. And somebody might know a language, this language or that language, and we would be having lectures in Swahili or
                    French or whatever. And we’d have enforced—we’d have quiet time.

                    This is quiet time, you know, for a while. Somebody would announce it. But we sort of—we had exercise time. Somebody was

                    The cell was, I think it was maybe seven or eight feet long—eight might be a stretch—and maybe six feet across. I
                    figured it out once that it was a little bit smaller than the cell that Nelson Mandela spent years in, and we had up to
                    three or four people in it, but usually two. And mattresses, unless they got—you know you aggravated the jailers by
                    singing and they could take your mattresses away.

                    Rabbi Nussbaum is truly one of my heroes. He would drive up from Jackson—where the Jewish community was not, you know,
                    smiled upon by the power structure—every week, faithfully. And I figured the only reason he was not killed on one of those
                    roads is that the power structure had given the word, “Don’t kill him.” But, you know, you could have had a rogue
                    Klansman any day take him out. He came up faithfully every week. And they’d come down. They’d call out, “Want a prayer
                    with the rabbi? Call out your cell number!” And they’d push a little button to open up your gate, and you’d go up. And
                    by the time this had happened a few times, I remember it as we were standing more or less in a circle. You know, at first we
                    may have been sitting on benches. But we’d be gathered around, and he would start to pray in Hebrew. And it would sort of
                    lull off the wardens and all, and then he’d be slipping in little bits of new, world news. And then, he’d switch back to
                    Hebrew, and after a while, he’d slip in a little more news.And then, he would get to see each of us individually for a
                    couple of seconds and maybe, “Your mother says your aunt is sick,” or “Tell my mother da-de-da,” and he’d send out
                    a form letter to all the families with a note at the bottom to keep this communication secret, or it may have to stop. And
                    that was our big thrill of the week. Now, one week, a couple of Catholic guys showed up, and I think they were seminarians.

                    No, they came to minister to us. And you could pick between the rabbi and the seminarians. And, you know, I grew up in a
                    Jewish community, or a lot of Jewish playmates, and a man of God was a man of God. I wasn’t going to be picky, but if we
                    had a Christian, I would favor the Christian, even though I wasn’t Catholic. But there were no Presbyterians. So, I went
                    to pray with the Catholics. Now, we had girls from Jewish families who were not observant or practicing or whatever. And
                    they had not gone to see the rabbi, because they thought that would be sort of hypocritical of them. Man, some of them were
                    down on me for deserting the rabbi and going with the Catholics!

                    When we first came into Jackson in 1967, there were two Klan bombings we heard. The first was at the synagogue. The second
                    was at Rabbi Nussbaum’s home. And that was six years later.

                    Well, I didn’t need to. I had a two-month sentence, which covered. And then, I had the two-hundred-dollar fine, which
                    every additional day counted three dollars against. And I had free room and board for the summer. I had been accepted at
                    Tougaloo College before the Freedom Rides. And I figured, “I’m in Mississippi,” and the idea was fill the jails and
                    make it so inconvenient for the great and sovereign state and the feds that the law would be obeyed.

                    Early September, because the rabbi—I remember him telling us that, “Next week I won’t be here, because it’s a holy
                    day, and I have to be with my congregation,” and it must have been the New Year. And I got out that week. School started,
                    you know, not the first of September. So, if we went back and checked the calendar for that year, we could figure it out.

                    In Jackson. And I was there for a couple of days before I went to Tougaloo. But this was where I got, you know, clothes
                    provided by Womanpower Unlimited and freshened up and saw some old friends at the Freedom House. And then went out to
                    Tougaloo.And I had applied to Tougaloo in reaction to when Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton Holmes had gone to Georgia
                    and been driven off with riots and tear gas. And the picture of Charlayne clutching her Madonna just spoke to me. And my
                    family was from Georgia, and somebody could have, relatives could have been in the crowd.So, I had felt that if this school
                    integration was for real, it had to be a two-way street. And I would apply to historically black colleges. And, okay, they
                    may not want me, but I will reach out. And Tougaloo accepted me. Somebody in SNCC suggested I apply to Tougaloo because
                    there had been no student movement there yet, and “it’d be good for you to be there.”

                    But Tougaloo had figured that its charter was older than the segregation laws, so it was like grandfathered, and its
                    financial support was from the North.

                    had bathrooms down the hall, you know. And I was tiptoeing down the hall in sort of a little flimsy outfit. And a girl was

                    so, the idea of white students on the campus was not, you know, breaking news.

                    then I saw you had to study just as hard as we did over in the library.” And so, I think, particularly when I came back
                    the second year, I was in. I was still involved with SNCC and CORE down, a little part-time—

                    What were doing that academic year, ’61-62, in terms of Movement activity? It should be pointed out that Tougaloo was
                    about six miles north of downtown Jackson, so it was somewhat isolated at the time.

                    To the extent we had a movement on campus, I was involved in that. I mean, whatever was happening. I was also involved in
                    other campus activities. It wasn’t just Movement. But I would, I guess, on weekends or when I could, go down—they had
                    the SNCC/CORE Office down on Lynch Street, a block or so from Medgar’s office, and I would do secretarial work down there.
                    It was generally—well, white women with SNCC did not go into the Delta, did not go outside of Jackson. It would be
                    counterproductive to go get us all killed, which made sense to me. But I kept that Movement connection and had to get my
                    lessons out. God help me with math and science!

                    Ed King was the white chaplain from Vicksburg, and he was very strong on the Movement. That’s why he was there. And the

                    hall. His wife, Jeanette, always had coffee brewing sort of just outside the room. It was also the guest bedroom if Attorney
                    Kunstler was down. And I remember typing up—I could type as fast as he could dictate, so I was typing up legal documents
                    as he was pacing around in his boxer shorts. [Laughter] And what is happening in ’62, and what is happening in ’63, I

                    John Salter was a political science professor, Northern or Western radical organizer, professor, and he started the North
                    Jackson—well, he was the adult sponsor of the North Jackson Youth Council of the NAACP. And it’s a small campus. His
                    house was also a Movement headquarters. If you weren’t over typing for a lawyer or hanging out or something at Ed’s, you
                    were over at John’s stuffing envelopes for the boycott that got going.

                    That’s possibly true. There were different settings. I don’t remember Joyce on that point, and we ended up being
                    roommates and sorority sisters. But I was getting the field reports from the Delta. And I would take them and pull out
                    gossip and news and make a little, I don’t know, three or four pages, maybe two or three pages, stapled together that
                    we’d run off—these were carbon copies, The North—let’s see, The Mixissippi News. [Laughter] So that, before the

                    Oh, yeah! I couldn’t go up into the Delta, being white, but I certainly knew what was going on. And people, for R&amp;R,
                    would be down at Tougaloo or at the Freedom House on Rose Street. So, I was, in some ways, more in touch with what was going
                    on here and there than some of the people out there were. I remember we went up to Hodding Carter’s office, Ed King and I,
                    and I forget who else was in the car, once. And, oh, my lands, to openly go up into the Delta! I mean, that was a big event!

                    In 1962, Jackson, Mississippi, the capital, was a segregated city. And the civil rights activists were trying to change all
                    that, and events unfolded that would have national and international significance, in terms of what was going on. Talk a

                    But by spring, they decide to escalate a bit. And demonstrations—there had been some picket demonstrations, and people
                    arrested and students and faculty, and the point now coming that they needed to step it up a little bit more. And
                    apparently, a sit-in was planned. I wasn’t in on the planning of this. And I wasn’t supposed to be part of that sit-in.
                    There were going to be—I’ve heard different versions of this. There was either going to be two demonstrations, complete
                    entities in themselves, or the picket line down the street was to be a diversion to draw the police down there. That’s
                    what I’d always understood. And I was going to be a spotter. Now, a spotter is a person who just sort of blends into the
                    crowd, sees what’s happening, has some dimes in their pocket to call Medgar Evers’ office and say, “Hey, they’ve
                    been arrested, they’ve been beaten up,” or whatever.

                    It was an integrated picket line. She may well have been in it. Eddie O’Neal, the student body president, I think was in
                    it. We thought the police would come down and arrest them right away, and that would give time for the people who were going
                    to be sitting in down at Woolworth’s to get into the store, and make their little purchase, and get situated. But the
                    picket line was arrested right away. So, here Lois and I are. We phoned in. And, “Okay, now what are we going to do?
                    Let’s go down to Woolworth’s and see what’s happening there.”

                    They thought the people sitting—as I understood it at the time, they thought the people sitting in would be arrested right
                    away, and we would just be—the picket line would just be a diversion to give them time to get in, and the police would
                    come down there and arrest them. Well, the Supreme Court had had a ruling the week before that the police could not, of
                    their own volition, go into a store and make arrests. They had to be invited in by the store manager, the irony being that
                    my name was on one of the cases that had been consolidated for this coming out of Durham. And there were cases from
                    other—I think Glen Echo also was in on this.

                    White students. And I think some of the segregationist honchos of the Sovereignty Commission, or whatever, were sort of
                    encouraging people to come up and come in the store. Well, Memphis Norman got pulled. There were three students from
                    Tougaloo sitting down: Annie Moody, Memphis Norman, and Perleana Lewis. And they were sitting together, with Memphis in the
                    middle, and he got pulled off the stool and stomped and kicked—and that’s a long story well-known—and carted off by
                    the police, along with the guy who was attacking him, who was a former policeman known for his brutality.That left the two
                    girls alone. They were pulled off their stools, struggled back. Things were getting more and more mob scene-ish.

                    Oh, no, they were outside laughing! Ed King was the spotter—the white chaplain was the spotter there and talking with the
                    police, who, “Oh, we can’t go in!” You know, “The Supreme Court ruling—we have to obey it!”And I think it was
                    probably Ed who suggested that I sit down with the girls, that it would be safer for me, because I was starting to be sort
                    of spotted. I think I maybe called out to one of the girls that somebody had a knife. And it would be safer for
                    me—you’re always safer if you’ve got a solid barrier on one side of you; that limits how many directions they can come
                    at you—and it would be good moral support for the two girls at the counter. So, I sat down. And then, we got pulled off

                    Perleana was. And Lois sat with Perleana, so you had a black and white girl here, and Annie and I sat, black and white girl
                    here. And little people with bravado would do this and do that, throw something at us, dump some ketchup maybe. And then, Ed
                    is called back to Medgar’s office. And Medgar wants to come down, but he’s talked out of it, because he’d be killed
                    pretty much on sight. But John comes down.

                    John Salter, the white professor, comes down, and he makes his way to where Annie and I are sitting. I think Walter
                    Williams, who had been the student body president at Jackson State but expelled for supporting, I think, the Tougaloo Nine
                    sit-in, library sit-in group. Well, things keep going. [Volume increases] And there’s Annie looking like a skunk with the
                    white sugar on her head, and me with all sorts of nice condiments, and John Salter, who really got the brunt of the attack
                    because he was a guy, and brass knuckles mixing blood with the mustard and things—got called “The Mustard Man” by the
                    press.Now, the guys in sunglasses, as I understand it, were all FBI agents cleverly disguised. But basically it’s high
                    school students who were there. The reporter, a local guy, Fred Blackwell, was literally standing on the counter when he
                    took this shot, as I understand it.

                    I think the Greensboro sit-was nice and orderly. This one you have a definite feel of violence. It’s imminent, but there
                    is no actual violence happening at the moment the camera clicked. But it tells the story. And it’s an integrated group.

                    battlefield, like the real me had left and was sort of like up there like a guardian angel, keeping an eye on things,
                    looking out for me, and this was just a shell that was sitting at the counter.

                    Well, our college president, when he heard about it, came down and worked it out, negotiating that the police would give us
                    safe passage once the store was closed, that cars could be brought up to pick us up. The manager didn’t want to close the
                    store, but apparently his regional district man said to. But out college president did come down and get things worked out
                    and actually sat at the counter, albeit down a bit, talking to the reporters. But he’s the only college president who sat
                    at a lunch counter where his students were.

                    sidelines, realizes that this is big news. The national office comes to town. Roy Wilkins gets himself arrested. And yet, at
                    the same time, there is an effort on the part of the Kennedy administration—we know this from the records—to get people
                    out of the streets, to arrange some sort of a compromise. Birmingham had exploded already. The Kennedys did not want to see
                    anything like this happen in Jackson. How much of this were you aware of on campus, that things that had been at white heat
                    were now sort of tampering back?

                    We should probably mention that at the height of all this, Medgar Evers was assassinated by a member of the White Citizens
                    Council, Byron De La Beckwith, and at the funeral there were demonstrations, and that John Doar of the Justice Department
                    was able to keep things from exploding into a full riot. By this time, you were back in Washington, working on the March on
                    Washington. Do you want to—anything more you want to say about the Jackson movement, or should we move on to Washington?

                    I was here, basically working in the press section at the March on Washington headquarters. And we certainly didn’t assume
                    that the March was going to come off or smoothly. The newspapers were full of stories of worries about riots. Merchants were
                    boarding up their windows downtown.

                    The American Nazi Party was right across the river. There was a real fear of violence in the city. Plus, at the March
                    office, we figured that it was also quite likely that the federal government would intervene and literally prevent the
                    busses from rolling into Washington. So, the fact that that took place was wonderful.

                    Yes. And we camped in a national park, I think, along the Blue Ridge, or Shenandoah National Park. And when we came out of
                    the shower room together, we got quite the looking over. [Laughter] But we got back and went to school. And then, there was
                    the church bombing. So, a van-load of us went over to the funerals for three of the girls. And there was still glass in the
                    gutters, which we were picking up, and shotgun shells where the police had fired over the heads of the people coming out
                    over the bombed church. And, to me, that was the absolute worst day in the Movement. There were sharpshooters on the roofs
                    of buildings, with their guns pointed down at the crowds at the street, which sort of makes you wonder.

                    The church visits had started that summer, I think maybe just before Medgar was killed, but while the cattle barns were
                    being filled up with demonstrators in Jackson, and to try to speak to the conscience of the people going to church, you
                    know, you’re welcome, Jesus. And integrated groups would go to the churches, and sometimes the police would move in and
                    arrest them. Sometimes they would be turned away and leave. If the police arrested them, it was before they had a chance to
                    leave. And, of course, there would be spotters. And by fall, when I got back, it was—ministers would sometimes come down
                    from the North and try to visit their denomination with students, or it would be a black and white group of ministers and
                    what-have-you. And every once in a while, you’d get in church.

                    Yeah. And there’s been a radical change. But I’ve met people in recent years in Mississippi who, by way of introduction
                    and explaining who they were, “my father was one of the signers of the Statement of Conscience” that the what, 28 or 30
                    or whatever ministers came up with. And most—Methodists and most were forced from their churches in Mississippi.

                    It’s extremely difficult to be white in Mississippi and to do anything except be quiet or support the Citizens Council, or
                    risk, as Ed King did, being ostracized throughout the community.

                    Yeah. And it’s understandable those that didn’t make a loud noise. But a lot—an awful lot of people did things quietly
                    and, you know, somewhat behind the scenes. So, I can understand the current Pope may well have opposed the dictators in
                    Argentina.

                    Well, contrary to what Anne says, I was not planning to come back for Freedom Summer. I had already decided that I had come
                    to Mississippi to be a student. And it just felt natural to leave when I was no longer—once I got my degree. And so, the
                    obvious place to go back to was Washington, D.C.

                    Canton had been completely off-limits to whites in the Movement. It was such a rough town. And it was under curfew. The
                    school year was over. Freedom Summer was looming. Over at Ed King’s, we decided to take a carload of everyone white in the
                    car to the mass meeting that night. It was Ed’s car, but we decided it would be better to let Hamid Kisselbash from
                    Pakistan drive, swarthy white. And the meeting was over before the curfew, so people could get home.We noticed we weren’t
                    being followed when we left campus and heading into Canton. And we weren’t being followed by the police—there were no
                    police around when we left. But we realized that we were being followed. And the interstate had just opened, and we were in
                    that sort of little no-man’s-land between the old road and the new road, I mean, and the interstate. We were being
                    followed and we got boxed off out in that little stretch, and guys with crowbars coming out.Now, a couple of days before, or
                    the day before, the leader of the opposition party in the legislature or parliament in India had been arrested in Jackson,
                    going Gandhian-style in sympathy with us, to a restaurant. And this had upset the embassy in Washington, which passed the
                    word to the State Department, which passed it down to the state of Mississippi, who obviously passed it on to local law
                    enforcement officials.I was in the backseat. Ed was in the front with Hamid. And long story, but they got the door open,
                    were beating on Hamid, and Ed telling them, “Don’t hit him! He’s a foreigner! He’s not part of—you know, we’re
                    whites. We’re local. He’s a foreigner. He’s from India! He’s from India! Don’t hit him! He’s from India!” And
                    Hamid is dazed and bleeding, “I’m from Pakistan!” [Laughter] “What’s that?” “That’s his city in India!”
                    [Laughter] And the guy who Ed was making eye contact with the most, who seemed to be the leader, gradually pulled the others
                    off, suggesting that he had gotten the word and had law enforcement connections.

                    And we got out of there. And the governor had said that there would be no violence, there was no violence, and if there was,
                    he wanted to be the first to know. So, we went to the governor’s mansion, dripping blood up the steps, Ed and Hamid. And
                    once they realized who they were, the governor wasn’t—you know, they couldn’t get in and went to the hospital. Oh, we
                    stopped at the state highway patrol on the way, and they said if you have a problem, you have to go back to Canton and tell
                    them. Well, you know, that was not a pretty picture.

                    So, then the governor’s mansion, then the hospital. And my understanding is that we were supposed to have been killed that
                    night to stop Freedom Summer. This comes—Ed said a Klan informer, well, undercover, got this word to them. And the fact
                    that we didn’t die that night meant that three other guys did. Two of them were our friends.

                    No. But, you know, you knew they were dead. I was working at the Smithsonian. And I guess I got on with a few of the black
                    workers well enough that they knew I—felt I was of them. There was always a question with who’s—who was I one of? This
                    bit on campus with the visiting white ministers who thought I was one of them, as opposed to the students who thought I was
                    one of them, led to some weird moments.But one of the black workers told me that they had brought in Chaney’s body on the
                    weekend after dark to be examined by the forensic people there, and there was not a bone in his body that was not broken.
                    Now, this—never saw anything in the press. This was just word in the hallways, which I tend to believe.

                    Well, it did. It did get into the press, because a Dr. Spain from the Medical Committee for Human Rights examined him. And
                    it was that famous comment that went all over the world, saying, “The only time I’ve seen a body so beaten up was in an
                    airplane crash.” So, that word did get out. But before, in the original, with the Mississippi examiners, nothing was said
                    of that.

                    didn’t hear it in the Smithsonian, but I could have missed that.

                    Um-hmm, yeah. Well, I mean, that was the original story that went out. And that was why Dr. Spain’s examination, which he
                    made at the request of Mrs. Chaney, which also took a lot of guts on her part, that—then that it was just a cover-up.

                    And we don’t know exactly what went on, but the best evidence we have from informers is that both Goodman and Schwerner
                    were shot and that Chaney tried to run away, and they literally beat him before they shot him. But it was the kind of thing

                    meet Stokely.” “Oh, Joan, don’t! Something will happen, and it will be upsetting, and they won’t understand.”
                    “No, I’m going to do it.” So, I take the twins out, these little freckle-faced, blond, Irish-looking kids, St.
                    Patrick’s Day, to meet Stokely.Now, between Stokely and the lobby and the entrance from Constitution Avenue is a
                    semicircle of bodyguards from The Nation, looking very intimidating. Stokely’s talking to some officials. I catch his eye.
                    Cuts off the conversation with the bigwigs, motions me over. “Stokely, I’d like you—I’d like my kids to meet you.”
                    Now, Stokely was what, 6’2”, 6’3”? This towering fearful figure knelt on the floor to talk eyeball-to-eyeball to
                    them, shake their hands, and, “What’s your name?” And, “How old are you?” And all this little stuff. I mean, we
                    were old friends, and that counted more than the raised fist.

                    I had one white from Duke who said that he was at a speech that Stokely gave, you know, one of the fire-and-brimstone
                    speeches, and that afterwards, why, they went back to this guy’s house and drank wine and listened to classical music.

                    Well, I came back, worked a number of menial jobs, because—don’t hire women, they just get married and have babies and
                    quit. So, I got married and had babies and quit, [laughter] five of them, boys! Involved in the community things and the
                    schools and PTAs and speaking for the school board a number of times on issues that you could trace back to the Civil Rights
                    Movement perspective, and in the classroom as a teaching assistant for, oh, close to 30 years, and brought a lot of
                    perspectives in just thinking outside the box, and appreciation of understanding of cultural issues to the classroom. And
                    now that I’m retired from that, I’m still speaking!

                    To thank you. This has been an enlightening interview. But before we go, I want to add that one of Joan Trumpauer
                    Mulholland’s sons, Loki Mulholland, has a video documentary about his mother’s life, titled An Ordinary Hero: The True
                    Story of Joan Mulholland. We’ll get a zero in on that right away. And what a fitting tribute, and from your son!
