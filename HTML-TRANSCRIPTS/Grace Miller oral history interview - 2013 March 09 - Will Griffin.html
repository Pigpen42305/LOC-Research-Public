                Yes. My mother—my father was named Joe Nathan Hall, my mother was named Nannie Hall, and I was the sixth child. It was six
                of us, and I was the baby of the group. And we were reared there in Baker County.

                married, because I had to go to school right on, and my parents were so upset, because I was the baby.

                I didn’t know how to cook, I didn’t know how to wash, I didn’t know how to do anything! And he told my parents. They
                said, “My baby don’t—uh-uh, she just can’t do it.” And he said, “You know what?” Said, “Whatever she does is
                fine with me.” Said, “She don’t have to cook if she don’t want to,” [laughter] because I would do the cooking. My
                husband was nine years older than me. So, we got married and we had a beautiful married life. We had five girls and one boy.
                And he was a great father. Those girls, they took him from me. They would call him “their daddy,” [laughs] and a lot of
                times I would be jealous, because he would take them—he was just a good father. He loved those kids! I wasn’t really
                jealous of the kids, but I wanted some of the attention that he gave them. [Laughs]

                And it would be cold. It would be real cold. And we would get to school, and I would tell my daddy—the teacher would say,
                “Well, we need some wood.” And I’d tell my daddy when we’d get home, I’d say, “Daddy,” I said, “My teacher
                said we need wood.” I wouldn’t sleep until he’d go get that wood! [Laughter] He’d have to go get it and stack it up
                and put it where I could see it to know that we’d have a fire the next day at school.And the buses—the white kids had
                the bus to ride. They would pass through there with us, throw spitballs at us, and we were freezing, and they in a bus. But
                you know what? We kept going.

                And we learned songs and we learned poems, you know, those poems and Bible verses is with me today. I think if you start off
                teaching a child at an early age about God and life and how to live, it will go along with them. But today’s time, they
                can’t teach that kind of thing.

                And I believe that’s why we are having so much trouble in our schools, because they are not being taught the right—you
                know, about life skills. They are not being taught about them. Even now, in our schools, we don’t have Home Ec anymore.
                And, see, those teachers back then taught Home Ec. They taught you how to sew on buttons on your clothes. They taught you
                how to cook and how to save. But, see, now they don’t teach those things. And our children are just so wasteful, and they
                don’t know how to be observant, you know, how to save. And I think if we could go back to some of those old days, our
                whole world would be in a better shape.

                enough to start dating, as they say. So, he kept—we kept going to church, and he kept talking. We secretly courted,
                because I wasn’t really old enough. [Laughing] My parents didn’t know I was dating him. So, after I got to high school,
                we started—I would start playing basketball.

                I’m going.” And just as I got up and got dressed, one of his brothers came in and told me at six o’clock in the

                Because I had those kids. I had never worked and had them to take care of and expecting a baby. And, you know, that

                three weeks old when they started. But they went to jail. But when the people would march and come back, they would come out
                to the house and eat and sit out on the lawn.

                They just stood by me. The whole community did. And it really helped. I don’t know what I would have done if I hadn’t
                had loving people in the community like I had. Because I had a sister-in-law stayed with me at night. And I had a friend
                that lived close to me stayed until in the night, trying to help us to heal. The kids would come in from school, and that
                was really the time that they would be with their daddy. You know, he would be there, helping with homework and playing with
                them and doing things. And that was a hard time for them. They just went through so hard a time. But after the baby came, it
                sort of helped us a lot. We had him to play with, and, you know, they had never had a brother, and it sort of helped to
                relieve some of the pain for them.

                He never told me anything. I never talked to him anymore, because I didn’t even want to see him anymore. Because when I
                would meet him, it looked like my blood would just go up in the top of my head. And I just had to pray and ask God to
                don’t let me feel that way, because I knew it was injuring me. But, then, somebody told him how I felt or something, and
                he stopped coming through our way. He’d go around the other way. And he sent word to tell me that he wasn’t going to
                harm me and the kids. But I just—it was just hurting. Um-hmm, it really was.

                this morning, and I’m going to ask them—I’m going to tell them I want to register.” So, we stopped by my

                I’m going, too.” Her name was Josie Miller.

                States and Baker County?” You know. They got a long sheet, because they felt like a lot of the people couldn’t read and
                write, and that would stop them from voting. So, then, we had to call—get the Justice Department to come in. Sherrod and

                just had built our house—I’ll say him. He stayed one week in the house when he got killed. And there was a lady at
                Family and Children’s Service down in Newton. I went down to try to apply to help me with—something for the kids.

                And they burned a cross in the front of my house. One of my daughters was at the dining room table, getting her homework
                out. I was in bed. And she said, “Mother,” said, “it’s a fire here! It’s a lot of cars!” And I jumped up, and
                you could see the cross burning.And I tell you what, you can get so angry till you don’t think about death, I guess. I got
                up—my husband loved to hunt. He was a—he loved to quail hunt. And he had plenty of ammunition around there and he had
                taught those girls how to shoot. So, I was giving one a gun, told one to get on the telephone, and I had one. I had the pump
                gun. And I was on the porch and I was pumping that gun [laughing] as fast as I could. I said, “If they come, they might
                get me, but I’m going leave one out here!”So, my neighbor saw it. The kids called him, and he saw it and he got in his
                car and he drove down there. And my brother, they got him, and my brother-in-law, Walt Miller, he started shooting. And when
                he jumped out of the car, drove past them and started shooting, then they started leaving. And I don’t know, but I really
                believe some of them got some bullets in them, because it was some firing going on! In about an hour, it was about fifty
                black men in my yard! And we called the sheriff. The sheriff’s son was in it, because I recognized a lot of those men was
                there. I recognized them, because I could see from the fire, and they was that close to my house. And so, the sheriff talked
                to—had the GBI, we called them out there.

                “It’s nothing for me to say.” He said, “Well, I want to get your view of it.” I said, “They burned a cross, and

                bullet hit my window, and glass was down on the floor the next morning. And one of my daughters asked me why was that glass

                happened. I just didn’t want them to be afraid.So, I would take them—they had a flood down in Newton at that time, that
                year, and they wanted to go see the water. And I carried my kids down to see the water. And some of the white—those young
                white guys were down there, and they was teasing each other, going on about “the man killed the coon,” you know.
                “They’re down here, but that coon got killed,” and all of that, you know. And my kids went through a lot.

                but it was rough. All of those kids that went to school at that time, they really caught it, from the teachers and the kids.
                My daughter told me one day, said they was in the lunchroom. And one of the teachers came through, “Let that
                Nigrette”—said they wouldn’t say “Negro”—”Let that Nigress get by!” [Laughs] Said it so, so—you know, they
                could say it, but they said it the way they wanted to say it, so ugly.

                there.” And the superintendent’s office was down in the little town. The principal had carried her down there, now. And
                she’s sitting up in there when I got there. And I was so upset.And what happened, now, the little thing that happened: she
                said it was a big fat white guy that go there. They told her she was liking him. And she had a nephew, now, he was really

                wouldn’t want her to say even anything to him!”But we—it was rough. It was rough. But they didn’t take another one
                down, because they knew I meant what I said. And I told them, “Down there with two men in that office, my little
                daughter,” you know, and both of them was white. And I was just upset, because the way they were treating them, they could
                have done anything to my daughter. But that didn’t happen anymore. And it—

                I asked them would they vote for me if I would run. What did they think about it? And everybody in the church said that
                would be a great idea if I would run, that they would support me. So, that time to pay in, I was going to go down to pay in.
                And my cousin said, “I’m—” Julius Williams—he said, “I’m not going to let you go by yourself. I’m going with
                you.” And he said, “What time are you coming down?” I said, “Well, when we have our break at ten o’clock, I’ll
                be down and pay in.”So, I went down and I told the guy that I wanted to pay in for—to run for the Board of Education. He

                And the guy shook my hand, and he said, “We will always be friends, and any way I can help you, I will do that.” I told
                him, “Thank you. I appreciate it.” So, when we had the first board meeting, the superintendent said, “This is our new
                board member, Mrs. Grace Miller. I don’t know whether all of you all know her or not.”And it was an old man on there, a
                white guy, and he—I imagine he was about 80-some years old. He looked like he was at that time. His name was Roy Kelly.
                And he had lost his billfold, and my daddy found his billfold. And he said, “Who are your parents?” I said, “My daddy
                is named Joe Hall, and my mother is named Nannie Hall.”He said, “Joe was one of the best niggers, I can say, in Baker
                County.” Said, “I lost my life savings in my billfold, and he found it and he gave it to me.” And he said, “I just
                thought,” he said, “I thought I would never get it.” Said, “Because—but he was an honest man.” I said, “Well,
                you know what? He always taught all of us honesty.”So, but when he said “nigger,” the other board members, they
                looked—and the superintendent said—he looked at me. And I guess they thought I was going—

                Going to say something. But I told them, I said, “I can understand Mr. Kelly.” I said, “He done said ‘nigger’ so
                much, he didn’t realize what he had said.” I said, “But if it was a young guy that asked—but, Wayne, if you had said
                it, it would have made a difference with me.” I said, “But Mr. Kelly didn’t realize what he was saying. But I want you
                to understand this.” I said, “Our little word—sometime I might get upset and I might say ‘cracker,’ and I want you
                to take it the way I took it.” And we never had any—I worked with them. I never had any problem with them. Because I
                learned one thing: I had to listen and I had to learn. Then, I had to work with them, and they worked with me. Any problem
                that we had, they would explain it to me. And if I said my opinion in there, they looked like they would really respect my
                opinion. And then, when I would say something, tell them something, they did the same thing. So, we really got along. They
                saw I wasn’t in there to try to be a bully. I wasn’t in there to try to—the only thing I was concerned about was our
                kids in Baker County.And that’s my thought until I left: the kids of Baker County. We’re having problems with our
                schools now, but I’ll be right there. And I tell them, I say, “The only thing I’m concerned is about our children. If
                we can just educate our kids, there will be less welfare, there will be less crimes, all of us work together and try to help
                these kids.” And that’s my philosophy up until this day.

                Well, the trouble there is—the issues now. We’ve got an all-white board except one, and she’s just there. They came in
                there, fired our attorney first, fired our superintendent—he’s black. He got in there with—the school was in debt.
                He’s gotten our school out of debt and he’s doing a good job. The teachers, the children, all respect him. And now, they
                are going to pay him out of his contract. Now, the contract is up in June. Well, he’s got a year’s contract. But until
                June, when school is out, they could have let him stay on, because the CRCT test is coming up.

                CRCT, uh-huh. CRCT test is coming up, and he knows about the testing and all, and they’re getting him out of there. And
                they don’t respect him at all. The first meeting they had, instead of accepting his agenda, they brought their own agenda.
                And, see, when you have an agenda, you’re supposed to publicize it. They didn’t publicize theirs. They just brought
                their own agenda, and wouldn’t even pay attention to his agenda at all. And they’re not giving no respect to him. And
                the lawyer let them go—they got a new lawyer. And I know he knows better, because he’s from Albany. He’s over every

                couldn’t sit in the same rooms when we’d go to the doctor, had separate—“colored” on one side, and “white” on
                the other side. A lot of these kids today don’t know that, because things had already happened. We had already suffered
                through it and got it for them. And they just don’t—I think we need to make sure they get more history of what’s going
                on, and it might remake the whole thing. But, see, now in school they don’t give it to them.

                whole community would do better. It would be more love, you know, if the younger, white and black, would know what happened.
                Because I’m sure a lot of the ones now today wouldn’t condone nothing like that, you know. But they just don’t know.
