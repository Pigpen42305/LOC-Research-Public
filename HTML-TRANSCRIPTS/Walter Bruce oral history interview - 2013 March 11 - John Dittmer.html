                we stayed, but we used to walk over there, you know, every two—we had like two Sundays a month. But, you know, we had
                to—I can always remember the creek running between our house and the church. We always would cut a tree and throw it
                across there, you know, and put some planks up there, you know, and walk across. That’s the way we went to church. They
                didn’t have no cars or anything like that then.

                I remember one time when I was small, I wanted to plow. And that was even before the Movement started. And I had been asking
                my daddy and telling him to let me plow. And so, the day that he set aside for me to plow, and then, he told me that day
                that I wasn’t going to be able to plow because his stock had got out.And there was a white fellow that lived on up above
                us. His name was Old Man Guess. And his stock got out, and when they went up around his house, he put them in the pasture up
                there, you know. And when my daddy went up there to get them, he told him he had to pay a dollar a head to get them. And he
                told him he didn’t have no dollar a head. And so, finally he came back to the house and told me that he couldn’t get
                them because he didn’t have no money. And so, I finally got the drop on him. And so, [laughs] after he kind of
                disappeared, then I went up there myself and knocked on the door. He said, “What you want, boy?” I said, “I come up
                here for my daddy’s mule.” He said, “Did he tell you that you’re going to have a dollar apiece?” I said, “Yeah,
                he told me.” I said, “I ain’t got no dollar.”And I said, “But I tell you what.” I said, “If you don’t let
                them out, I’m gonna let them out myself!” [Laughs] And he said, told his son, “Go out there and let that boy have them
                mules. That boy ain’t got no sense!” [Laughs]

                hard to get along with it. But, you know, it wasn’t too much you could do about it. But, you know, we kind of got along.
                As I said, out of all the time that I’ve been in the Movement, or even before the Movement, I never hated white folks. I
                just didn’t like what they—the way they, you know, did us, but I never did hate any of them like that or anything like
                that. But whatever I had to say or do, I just, you know, go on and do it.

                Yeah. After I got, you know, started in the Civil Rights Movement—I mean, when I first started, you know, I was thinking
                that wasn’t no whites going to hire me. That’s what I was kind of thinking about when I got started in the Civil Rights
                Movement. But then, I think the reason that a whole lot of them were still hiring me was because they were—they was kind
                of afraid if they didn’t hire me, you know, that maybe I would [laughs] do something against their business.

                Well, we—I mean, everybody around here was, you know, just really upset, you know. But we knew that, you know, certain
                things like that might would happen, because at that time, you know, I didn’t know—it’s just a gift, I’d say, and a
                blessing from God that I never got hurt because, you know, from what I was involved in in all these different places that I
                was going to and all these different times of night coming in. And it was—it was just rough back there. But people would
                always ask me was I afraid. And I told them the only time that I would be afraid was when I get ready to come into the
                house. I said as long as I was, you know, riding along, I never thought too much about it. But you just kind of had that
                feeling when you get out of your vehicle, you know, and get ready to come in the house or something like that. You had that
                feeling.

                community. That’s in the Delta. And most every time we would go down there to meet, and then, when we’d get back up to
                the highway, which was Highway 12, somebody was going to always get stopped there, you know. They just give them a ticket,
                even whether you violated or not. They just give you a ticket or just trying to stop you, you know, from going down there to
                the meeting. But every time that we had a meeting down there, somebody’s going—two or three people are going to get a

                able to vote, and so, they would be here to help us out. And so, when we first started to voting here, we had to do our—I
                mean, register—we were doing it down in the basement at the post office there in Lexington because they wouldn’t let you
                do it in the courthouse. Because whenever you’d go to the courthouse to try to register, they would know that black
                people, you know, couldn’t read too well and they would give them a Jackson Daily newspaper. And if they couldn’t read
                that newspaper, they wouldn’t let them register. And they also asked you how many strands of hair did you have in your
                head. [Laughs] And if you couldn’t answer that question, they wouldn’t let you vote. And then, they’d also ask you a
                question, like, if you fill a five-gallon bucket of water and drop a bar of soap in there, how many bubbles would it make?

                we had to re-register where we could get a chance to vote. But all that was—they just—they really didn’t want you to

                what we’re going to do. Or either just like—at that time, it was about 16 or 17 communities with the Freedom Democratic
                Party. But right now Holmes County is the onliest one that’s still got the party going. And so, we would meet up and
                decide what we were going to do. And the SNCC people, they would always be in there with us. But they—we always made the
                decision, you know, and then they would, you know, go along with us. And sometimes they’ll, you know, have an idea of what
                we need to do, and we worked right close together. Sure did.

                Well, what happened, Jay Young, he lived up here between here and West. And somehow, when he went to Lexington, they locked
                him up. It looked like he was, you know, drunk or something like that. But then, we know that wasn’t true, because, you
                know, as long as I’ve been knowing him and playing ball with him, I never know him to drink. And so, they locked him up.
                But, now, he did have a bad heart, and I think that they refused to give him that medicine. And so, that morning when they
                went in there, they found him dead.And so, then, me and Mrs. Hightower, we went over there, you know, to see what happened.
                And so, when we walked up to Calvin Moore, the sheriff then, and I asked him could we see him. He said, “Naw, y’all
                can’t see him,” said, “because he’s not even dressed.” And I told him, I said, “I don’t want him dressed.” I
                said, “I want to see him like he is.” He said, “Well, you can’t see him.” And I said, “You know what?” I said,
                “It’s going to be better on you if you let us see him.” And so, “Well, I’m going let y’all go in there, but
                y’all are the only two going to be able to go in there.”And I went in there and looked him all over, and I couldn’t
                find no scars or anything on him, you know, where he had been beat or hit or anything like that, because, as I said, I
                looked him all the way over. And then, when we come out from there, we decided to put on that boycott. And then, it went on
                for a few days, maybe a week or more. And so, we had a community store here, so I was in the store, because every time—

                Uh-huh. And so, I’ll go in the store, and Mrs. Georgia Clark—all of us worked together, and anything that happened in
                Holmes County going always, you know, confront me. And she come and told me, said, “They want you to come to Lexington.
                They done locked up twelve people.” And so, when I got ready to go to Lexington, when I got ready to walk out the store,
                then the sheriff and the deputy was coming in the store. And they said, “We’ve got a warrant for your arrest.” And I
                said, “Okay,” so they carried me on.We got in the car and we were going to Lexington. I said, “What y’all got me
                for?” He said, “We got—they said that you were hauling the peoples over there to march.” And I said, “Well, you
                must don’t know who bought that damn truck.” [Laughter] I said, “That truck belongs to me,” I said, “and I’ll
                haul any damn body that I want to!” And so, they carried on and locked us up. And so, then it wasn’t too long before my
                wife and brother came over to get me out. But I said, “No, I’m not going to get out now.” I said, “We’re all going

                around to Jackson and different places, you know, trying to get us convicted, but we . And then, the same night that we got
                in jail, there were so many people in Lexington that you couldn’t even walk around the streets.And so, when we got out of
                jail, then we formed another march. [Laughs] And then, we went to marching around the square. And they were running up
                beside of me, the whites was, “See can you get them to stop marching,” and all that. And we just kept going. And they
                said, “Well, if they don’t stop marching, we’re going to lock them up.”And so, they parked the car there and told
                them, said, “Y’all get in.” And so, everybody—they just filled the car up. And the man that was driving it, the
                police that was driving the car, couldn’t even get in there, because they [laughs] there were so many people in there. And
                then, they made them all get out. [Laughs] And so, it was kind of funny and dangerous, too.But, you know, whatever we
                planned to do or we decided to do, we’d go on and do it. And so, then they finally—and then we finally called it off
                after, you know, we kind of got what we were expecting and asked for. And so, then we called it off for that march.

                to be the chairman of the Freedom Democratic Party,” I said, “it was just only two years.” And I said, “Now, since I
                got to be chairman, and it’s going on 40-some years,” and I said, “and you still haven’t changed.” [Laughs]

                coordinator and the chairman from that day on up to today.

                Yeah, we—as I said, we were—at that time, we were—all the communities, most of the meetings, you know, had different
                nights. But in Durant, we always would meet on Wednesday night, and Lexington had a different night and Old Pilgrim Rest and
                Mileston and all of them. But we would all—and every third Sunday, we would have our countywide meeting, and that’s
                where everybody in the county would come to this meeting. And then, and that’s where we picked our—the people, you know,
                to go to these different conventions out of the countywide meeting every third Sunday. And so, we still meets every third
                Sunday.

                third Sunday we would always meet, you know, because, as I said, the county was real together then. And anywhere you’d
                meet, you know, you’d have a crowd. But at that time, we didn’t have a center like we have now, you know. So, we’d
                just meet at this church, maybe like this third Sunday, and the next third Sunday, another community might would have it.
                But that’s the way we, you know—and we would pick out our delegates, you know, who we were going to send to be the
                delegates from the Freedom Democratic Party, like that.

                couldn’t—we would talk to them all the time, but we just couldn’t ever get them to find out why they
                wouldn’t—well, we knew why they wasn’t coming, because, as I said, a whole lot of people back then were just really
                afraid. And then, after some of them, you know, found out what was going on, then a few more, you know, would ease on in.
                But the teachers and the preachers were really scared during the struggle.

                Yeah, and then I—you know, getting on to the teachers, some of them stated that the reason they didn’t come to the
                meeting because I just only finished twelve grades, you know, and there wasn’t nothing I could tell them. And then, later
                on, one of the teachers got fired. And so, that was down here at Williams-Sullivan High School, and they sent for me to come
                down there. I said, “Wonder why they sent for me to come down there, because they already said there wasn’t [nothing] I
                could tell them?”And so, when I went down there, it was nothing in there but teachers! And I told them, I said, “Well,
                now,” I said, “I’m surprised y’all asked me to come down here,” I said, “because I heard that y’all said that
                I just only finished twelfth grade and wasn’t nothing I could tell y’all.” I said, “Let me tell one thing.” I
                said, “Now, you’re right.” I said, “I can’t teach school.” I said, “And you can’t read a blueprint.”

                to give you the courage and not being afraid to speak out.” And I said, “But I tell you what.” I said, “Before the
                sun goes down,” I said, “the teacher that was fired is going to be back in his position.” And so, later on that
                evening, they called me back and told me he had his job back. And then, that’s when I told them, I said, “Now, that lets
                you know that when you’re together, you can get things done, but when you’re divided,” and I said, “and that’s

                Well, Sue and Henry were here at least five years, and they were real active. And anything that we were, you know, trying to
                do, they were right in there working. But they worked the whole five years that they were here [laughs], you know, helping
                anybody. And everybody seemed to love them. And we just all worked in there together.

                diversion here: Tell us a little bit about healthcare in the state. When you got sick when you were growing up, what was
                available to you? Did you go to doctors, a hospital? What kind of services were there in the county?

                Well, the services in the county back then was real poor for black folks. I mean, because, you know, someone didn’t
                go—we had a doctor. His name was Dr. Brocken. He used to go around, you know, to different people’s homes, you know, if
                they would get sick or something like that, because blacks didn’t go to no hospital too much, because they didn’t have
                no money or something like that, and no clinics. But, now, these doctors, they would, you know, some of them, you know,
                couldn’t even get to people’s house, because we didn’t have no cars and didn’t have no good roads and things.
                Sometimes they had to walk there at night. But it was real bad back then in them days.

                And so, he got involved with us up here at the school. And so, we had a meeting one night, and we had, you know, been
                talking about the school. And so, he—we appointed him—he was our attorney for the school up there. And then, he came
                back and told, you know, that we needed to appoint, to elect two blacks—you know, they didn’t want but two blacks to be
                on the board up there, because, see, they always wanted you to be the odd number. And so, they appointed me and . We were
                the first two blacks that served up there on that board.And so, then we got . And at that time, it was supposed to have been
                that when they hired the principal or the superintendent, one was supposed to have been black and one was supposed to have
                been white. So, it went on thataway for a while. But right now, the principal and the superintendent is black right now. But
                that’s the way it was organized.But, and so, because we tried to get them to merge with the county, but they figured if
                they did that, they were going to lose control, and so, they fought that. And so, they wouldn’t connect with the county
                schools. They wanted to stay up there, because they figured, you know, that they were going to over there. I never will
                forget. It was Doug and Hugh Carl, And—let’s see, Doug was a dentist. [Laughs] And so, they fought that. And so, then it
                was finally made them accept it, the school did. But the reason they were fighting it, you know, because they didn’t want
                to—they figured if they do that, you know, they were going to lose control over there, even though they were going to lose
                control of it anyway.And so, after it got like that, then a whole lot of white folks moved out of Durant. And so, right now,
                a whole lot of them moved out and still got houses for sale here. But that was the first thing, you know. And then, after
                that, you know, we integrated this Ritz Café. You couldn’t go in there but white, you know. You could go in the back, you
                know, and they would serve you back there.

                so, we had said we were going to do that that Saturday. And so, that Wednesday night, we suggested what we’re going to do.
                And the first time we had decided, he had an old German police dog he had tied up there by the—and so, we talked to the
                mayor and told him he better make him move that dog or we were going to get rid of it. And so, he finally moved the dog.So,
                we went around there. And he said, “Before I sell a nigger an ice cream out of that window where it says all-white,’”
                he said, “I’ll burn this son-of-a-bitch down to the ground!” His name was Mack Brown. [Laughs] And his son was working
                at the Merchant and Farmers Bank. That’s where he retired from. And so, now, I told him, I said, “Well, you know
                what?” I said, “Are you able to get you a match and set this so-and-so afire?” I said, “Because the next time we
                come around here to buy some ice cream,” I said, “it ain’t going be no sign up here saying no all-black, nor
                all-colored, nor all-white.”And so, that was on a Saturday. And so, that Sunday, we always park up there on the square,
                you know, when we get ready to go sing. And that’s where we meet at, you know. They park up there on the street, and then
                we get in the van or whatever we had to go. And so, I noticed when I looked—parked up there in the front, the boy didn’t
                have no signs period up there. And it wasn’t burnt down! [Laughter] And so, from that day on, we—you know, you could go
                to either window you wanted to.And then, the next one was the Piggly-Wiggly. At that time, we had—

            <p>
                Yeah, a grocery store. That was the one that the black bag boy and the white bag boy got in a fight. I think the black boy
                won the fight, but he fired him and he didn’t—and kept the white. And so, then we met that Wednesday night, and I told
                them what we were going to do. And so, we called him and told him he was going either have to give that black boy his job
                back or either fire both of them. So, he refused to do it.And so, then we boycotted. And so, we were out there not too far
                from the store—we were on the parking lot, but we—you know, you had to be a certain distance. And so, I never will
                forget it. I think it was maybe like that Monday, about three or four white families came through to go to the store. And
                they said, “What y’all doing?” We said, “Well, we’re boycotting the store because he fired the black boy and kept
                the white boy.” And they said, “Well, I don’t blame y’all.” Said, “We’ll go to another store.” And they just
                kept going around the thing and went on off.

                Yeah, it sure was. But they sure supported us, because they said, “We can go somewhere else.” And then, the white fellow
                that brings the chickens and things up there, you know, they have eighteen-wheelers and trucks loaded with chickens and
                things. And he went there. And so, when he—he didn’t unload. So, when he came out by us, he stopped. He said, “I
                don’t know what y’all are doing.” He said, “But whatever you’re doing,” said, “you keep doing it.” Said,
                “You’re going to get what you want,” said, “because this is the first time I ever come here with a load of chickens
                and had to carry all of them back.” [Laughs]And so, then the next day, he called me and said, “Well, we done got rid of
                the white boy.” And I said, “Well, we’ll be meeting this Wednesday night.” I said, “I can’t make that decision
                now.” I said, “I’ve got to go back to the meeting.”And so, that Wednesday night we met, and I told them what had
                happened. And some of them wanted—they agreed with me, and some of them said, “Well, he’s going to send him to
                Lexington.” I said, “I don’t care where he sent him.” I said, “We said fire him here in Durant.” I said, “If
                he want to carry him to Lexington, that’s good.” I said, “But we done what we asked for.” And so, and I said,
                “We’re going to lift the selective buying.” And then, after that, then he was one of our radio sponsors. He sponsored
                us until he went out of business.

                Well, the first incident I had real bad was in the school. It was in Attala County. And that was at the school there
                in—going in—it was in Attala County. And so, this young man—I think his mother or grandmother one called me
                because—it was in McAdams School, that’s where it was—and asked me would I go over there and see what had happened to
                her grandson.And so, at that time, as I said, I was building houses. And even if I was putting a top on a house, if somebody
                called me that was in trouble, I would get down off the house and go see about it. And so, that morning, I went over there.
                And so, I’d never taken a gun or nothing like that, because I know if I had a gun, you know, and they stop you, they’re
                going put you in jail or something like that. So, I didn’t carry no gun.And when I got over there, before I got over
                there, I couldn’t see nothing but blue lights. And so, I said, “Well, I don’t know what happened over here.” So, one
                mind said, “Go back,” and then, the other mind said, “No, go on. You done got this far. Go ahead.” And so, when I
                got down there, they had the sheriff, all his people there, the constables, and even just white people, you know, with guns.
                And so, I just got out and went on in there.And so, when I walked in the room, the sheriff was in there. And he said, “Can
                I help you?” I said, “I’m looking for the principal.” He said, “Are you the undercover man?” I said, “I’m
                looking for the principal.” “Are you FBI?” I said, “I’m looking for the principal.” “Are you a detective?”
                [Laughter] And every time he asked me a question, I’d tell him , I’d say, “I’m looking for the principal,” so I
                guess he found out that I wasn’t going to answer his questions. And he said, “The principal is not here. She’s
                sick.”And so, when I came on out, and the school had just had, just like you said, that was the first year of integration.
                And so, when I come out of the school, even like the blacks were afraid to talk to me, I guess. [Laughs] And so, when I got
                near ’bout back to the highway, one of the young men—I guess because he had a group, you know, and we used to sing on
                different programs together—and he said, well, that boy’s mother worked down at Carthage, that’s down there at the
                chicken place. And I drove all the way from there to Carthage. And then, I got to Carthage, and they told me she had come
                back to Kosciusko, and I had to drive back from Carthage back to Kosciusko. And then, I finally found her, and she said,
                “Well, he’s up there, and did I know the Careys in West?” I said, “Yeah, I know them.” And so, she said,
                “That’s where he’s at.”So, I went up there, and he finally come to the door. I said, “Now, don’t you come to the
                door for nobody else.” And he said, “Well, I didn’t rape that girl.” Because the kids, they wouldn’t go to class,
                because they thought they had killed him. And he said, “No.” Said, “I’ve been courting that girl ever since the
                school was integrated.” He said but what happened he went at this house and knocked on the window, and the girl came out,
                and they went on, you know, and did what they were going do.And when they finished, I guess, she got ready to go back to the
                house. I guess her mama and dad found out that she was out of the house. And so, when she seen all them lights on back in
                her house, she wouldn’t go back there. She went home with him. And he slipped her in his daddy’s house, because his
                daddy didn’t even know that the girl was in his house. [Laughs] And they found out that he had let them come in his house,
                and he’s in the bed with pneumonia and flu. But they got him out and knocked him up.

                there, and a whole lot of them did not put them up there, because I guess they were afraid something was going happen to
                them. But I believe the first ones that I can remember that put their kids up there was Hattie Bell Saffold and Louise
                Winters. And so, I know they put their kids up there. And so, then after people found out didn’t anything happen to them,
                then the other people went. And so, now it’s just about totally black. It might be a few whites up there.

                offenders over the coals for their fears, false excuses, and inactivity. And despite this, or maybe because of it, Durant
                meetings had more people attending, more money raised, and more projects involving more folks than anywhere else in Holmes
                County.” That’s a lot to deal with. Let’s start by talking—and you’ve mentioned this several times—the real
                fears that people had about getting involved. How did you deal with that? How did you get them to overcome their fears and
                take chances?

            <p>
                Well, as I said, I had been working with black peoples and young peoples almost all of my life. And they had quite a bit of
                confidence in me, you know, whatever I said, some of them would try it. But, now, it was kind of hard for a while, but they
                finally come on in there. And then, some of them was, you know, thinking that they was going lose their job if they got
                involved in this or that. And so, we just let them know, you know, that if you’ve got a job and ain’t got your freedom,
                you don’t have too much. And so, that was the way I always—and I always just had a whole lot of patience. And so, I just
                would work along with them and encourage them. But, as I said, we did that for a long time.And then, we didn’t have no
                center here in Durant, but we had a little old shotgun house out in the country that we were using, you know, for our
                meeting place. And we would meet out there every Wednesday night. And every Wednesday night, after we’d get opened up out
                there, it would be a carload of white people would come through and shoot over the top of that building. They didn’t shoot
                in the building, but they would shoot over the top of it. And after they’d shoot over the top of it, you’d come
                this-a-way and then go on around that way and hit another road and come back to Durant.And so, that next Wednesday night, I
                had organized a group and I told them, I said, “We’re going bring some guns out here this Wednesday night. And I don’t
                want you to shoot in the car, but just shoot over the car like they’ve been shooting over the building.” And so, I had
                about three or four on this side of the center, and three or four on this side of the center. And so, when they came through
                that next Wednesday night, just after we opened up—they were pretty near on time. They come by—pow, pow, pow, pow!—and
                go on around.So, this time, when they come on and were shooting over the building, and when they passed the building and
                went down that way, then my group opened up fire over their heads. And they turned around and come back. [Laughs] They
                didn’t go all the way around that time. They turned around and come back on this side. And when they got back on this
                side, then the group up there opened fire over their heads. And so, then I heard that [laughs] when they got back to Durant,
                they said, “You better not go out there!” Said, “Them niggers got all kind of machine guns out there!” [Laughs]
                There wasn’t no machine guns. They were just different ones firing.So, finally, a little later on, then we used to meet at
                this place. And we met at the church over there, called Second Pilgrim Rest Church, but—and some of the SNCC people, you
                know, were here, too. And so, they was coming on up that road and were going to come on to the meeting. And when they came
                by this church, they seen this rope. They had a grassroot rope that they had soaked in some gas. And they carried that rope
                in the church and tied it around the pulpit and brought it back outdoors, you know, and set it afire. But it just so
                happened that the Lord had sent them by there, and they seen that rope, and so they pulled it out of the church. And
                that’s the only thing, the reason that church is still setting there. And so, then I called the sheriff, Andrew Smith. He
                was the sheriff then. And he said—he was an old rednecker, I call him—and he was saying that he didn’t care what
                happened, and all that kind of stuff. He wasn’t going do this and he wasn’t going do that. And so, a little later on, I
                called him back. I said, “Well, I’ll tell you what.” I said, “You don’t have to send nobody out here.” I said,
                “But if I call you back,” I said, “we’re going to be calling you for you to send the ambulance out here, because
                anybody we catch trying to burn this church down, we’re going kill him.” And then, he sent his deputies out there.
                [Laughs]

                Now, that’s something I hardly ever did—carried a gun. As I said, now, when I went to Mileston, I didn’t know all that
                was going on. And, you know, I thought they might have just—because the grandmama, I think she thought that they had
                killed the boy, you know. But the reason I didn’t is because I know, you know, that if they catch you with a gun, they
                were going have, kind of have something that they’re going frame you, so, if they would stop me, they never would have
                found a gun on me. I didn’t really carry no gun. It was way on over in there before I started carrying a gun or anything.

                wasn’t going to stop us from meeting.

                The voting rights movement in Holmes County and in the rest of the South really got a boost by the passing of the Voting
                Rights Act in 1965, which made it much easier to register and vote, particularly with the federal registrars coming in, as
                they did.

                was the teachers and the preachers. Because I figured that the preachers didn’t have nothing that they should have been
                afraid of, you know, because they didn’t—they . Some of them might have been borrowing money, you know, from banks or
                something like that. But, then, as I said, the teachers, they—we did have a white superintendent. But, now, when the one
                that got fired, now, we had a black superintendent at that time, but the whites were over him, you know, and that’s where
                it was.

                were so important there in organizing these communities, in getting the vote out and selecting candidates. The first was in
                the general election of 1966, I believe, Ralthus Hayes ran for Congress in that district.

                would choose our candidates. Some of them, you know, we would appoint or ask, and then some of them would volunteer.

                Well, as I said, we came and, you know—all that, as I said, most would take place on a third Sunday, because the community
                meeting, you know, it would just be maybe just the community. But that third Sunday, everybody from the different areas of
                the county would be there. And that’s when we would choose our candidates and we would also know by how they were
                supporting their community, you know. If they wasn’t supporting their community meeting, you know, on Wednesday night or
                whatever night they had, we would be kind of skeptical of them. But they had to be showing their face for us to even decide
                that we were going to support him as a candidate.And, see, then, at that time, as I said, we were really together. And if we
                choose you, that we’re going to support you as a candidate, and then if somebody else decides to come out against you,
                well, we were strong enough at that time to let them know that we were going to support you. And if you want to run against
                him, then you’re going be out there on your own. And so, we would pick our candidates like that on Wednesday, and that’s
                where we came up with Mr. Hayes and Robert Clark and Griffin McLaurin. And everybody decided to run was always being
                selected on that third Sunday, not no community meeting.

                And you had a decision to make in 1967 that either you could have—Representative Clark, for example, could have run in the
                Democratic primary against a white candidate, or you could have run an independent slate and waited until the November
                election.

                Well, as I said, Representative Clark, he was pretty well-known and he communicated. Some of the whites, you know, were in
                his corner, and most all of the blacks. And so, but now, the person that he defeated, he was kind of—he had been in there
                a long time. But we all got behind him, and all of them said they were going to support him, and that’s the way they did.
                I don’t know why—why we picked November. [Laughs] Instead of having two chances, we just did one.

                Or did you make sure you had—were there any problems at the polls? Were whites—were they able to vote pretty freely, or

                No, there wasn’t no whole lot of intimidation around the polls. Some polling places, you know, we’d have a little
                problem, but not too often because they knew we were mean, you know, and they know that we was together. And they know that
                this thing had went so long. And I give them credit, now, because some of the whites, you know, they might not would have
                come in there, you know, because they didn’t know what their race was going do, just like we didn’t know maybe what our
                race was going do. But some of them, they knew it had been so long, and some of them, you know, were very cooperative.

                Yeah, that’s right. And then, I had other people, you know, that would tell me, and I told them—and then, they’d ask
                me, say, “I don’t know how you put up with fooling with all them different folks.” I say, “Well, they don’t worry
                me, because that all I did all my life, was concern about—.” And I said, and the main thing I said, and I still say that
                I never did hate white folks. But I said the only thing that I just didn’t like the way that they was treating the black
                folks. And that way you can get along and you can with anybody.And the main thing: I always have been outspoken. Whatever I
                have to say, I don’t care where I’m at or who it is, I’m going say it. And that goes a long ways, too. And I said, and
                I want all, the whites or blacks, to know I wasn’t for sale. I said I wasn’t out here trying to accept no money or put
                no money in my pocket, I said, because I wasn’t out there for. That’s the only thing I want is freedom.And I said the
                same thing I say today I said in the ’60s, and early ’60s, that you don’t need nothing all-black, you don’t need
                nothing all-white. And I say that in every meeting I go to right now. We don’t need all-black candidates and we don’t
                need all-white candidates. I always think it should be mixed. And I feel that way today.

                the majority always be the best thing. I said—and so, now, see, a whole lot of people will say, well, they’re going to
                support you because you’re black or this or that. I said, “But that’s not the name of the game.” I said, “God
                didn’t intend for it to be like that,” I said, “because if God had been pretending to be that he was for all-black or
                all-white, just like I said, the president we’ve got now never would have got elected.”

                there that God knows that this thing needs to be mixed.” And I said, “As long as I live, I will always stand by that.”
