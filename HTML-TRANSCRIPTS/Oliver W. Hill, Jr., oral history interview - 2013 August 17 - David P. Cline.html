                    Were there certain fixtures within that community, certain people who had—that were sort of heads of the community, or
                    certain businesses that were sort of like—?

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yeah. One of the things that was interesting was that the neighborhoods were very heterogeneous, you know, you would have a
                    lawyer next to a construction worker next to a plumber, and so, in terms of class, you had much more integration than you do
                    today. And, again, because there were so many restrictions on where you could go and where you couldn’t go, you know,
                    there were industries and commercial organizations to take care of whatever needs you had in the community. So, in that
                    sense, it was a very self-contained kind of community. And, I mean, my family was atypical in one sense, in that my father
                    was a civil rights attorney, and so he was traveling a lot. And he was involved with cases from the NAACP Legal Defense
                    Fund. We, as a result, would have a lot of threats coming in over the telephone. And so, I wasn’t allowed to answer the
                    phone for a long time [laughs] in the evenings. We even had a cross burned on our yard one time.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yeah, I was probably about six or seven. But, you know, it was exciting! [Laughs] I mean, my parents had consciously tried
                    to kind of build up my sense of self so that I would be shielded a little bit from the racism and the kinds of reprisals and
                    repercussions that were coming from my father’s work. And also, I think they also figured that I was going to be in the
                    group that desegregated schools in Richmond, and I was, so there was an attempt to try to inculcate in me the idea that
                    prejudice was somebody else’s problem, you know. It was an indication of their pathology, not my pathology.And that worked
                    to a certain extent. Although, in looking back on growing up in the fifties, I mean, the all-white world that you would see
                    on television and the media definitely had an effect on me. I mean, when I would color in a coloring book, I would never
                    think about coloring somebody’s skin brown, because the norm was white. You know, I wanted wavy hair like Elvis Presley
                    and [laughs]—so those kinds of marks were definitely there. But I did have a good sense of self, and my parents had done a
                    good job in protecting me on that level.

                    When you mention Elvis Presley and those kinds of things that are happening psychologically, did you have other heroes as a
                    kid?

                <p class='pad'>
                    Well, I mean, most of the heroes that I was exposed to in TV and comic books and things were white, and so I was kind of a
                    typical kid on that level. There really wasn’t a real push for black history at that time, and so I really hadn’t been
                    exposed to a lot of black heroes, although my parents had always talked to me about, you know, the heroes of the black
                    experience. It wasn’t a lot of written material on that, but they would, you know, tell me about it in the conversations
                    around the dinner table. And I was an only child, so they did include me in their discussions, you know, for the most part,
                    about issues of segregation and politics and anything else that might be happening around that time.

                    Could you tell us a little bit more about who your parents were, where they—what their backgrounds were and how they came

                <p class='pad'>
                    Um-hmm. My father was also born in Richmond in 1907, and early on, he moved to Roanoke. His father kind of deserted the
                    family early on, so he was being raised by his mother. And in Roanoke, she would go for seasonal work up to places
                    like—what’s the name of the resort hotels out there? I’m drawing a blank. Homestead and the Greenbriar.

                <p class='pad'>
                    And so, he was kind of put in this foster home of this middle class family in Roanoke, who did a lot of raising of him
                    during those early years, named the Pentecosts. And Mr. Pentecost—

                <p class='pad'>
                    Black family, yeah. But Mr. Pentecost was a very, I don’t know, well-read, well-spoken, very stern kind of person who
                    worked on the railroads. And my father was, you know, kind of living in that environment, and I think that had a big
                    influence on his early years. My grandmother remarried and eventually moved to Washington with her new husband. And so, my
                    father stayed in Roanoke until he was ready to enter high school, because at that time there were no black high schools in
                    Roanoke.

                    None. [Laughs] So, he then went to Washington for high school. And he went to a high school named Dunbar, which was a very
                    prestigious high school in those days. It was said they had more PhDs on their high school faculty than some of the colleges
                    in the area. [Laughs]

                <p class='pad'>
                    So, he had a great experience at Dunbar and kind of, you know, kind of got his academic footing. But he was still kind of a
                    devil-may-care type personality and—but he decided that he was going to go to college. And just before that, one of his
                    uncles had worked in a law office and gave him a copy of an annotated Constitution. And he said, in reading that, he
                    couldn’t understand why segregation laws were constitutional. And this is really what inspired him to go on to law
                    school.So, there was a convergence of things happening at that time at Howard in the late 1920s. There was a president
                    there, Mordecai Johnson, who was interested in producing a topflight law school. At that time, Howard’s law school was
                    just a night school. But he brought in a dean who had just got his PhD in law from Harvard, named Charles Hamilton Houston,
                    and so, Mordecai Johnson and Houston kind of molded the faculty and the organization of this law school. And so, Howard also
                    had a program where you could do three years of undergraduate and then go to law school and get your bachelor’s degree
                    after the first year in law school. And so, my father took advantage of that. One of his classmates was Thurgood Marshall,
                    who had been turned down from going to the University of Maryland Law School, so he was there for that reason. And they said
                    that the first day in class, Charles Hamilton Houston told them that, you know, as lawyers, you’re either a social
                    parasite or you’re a social engineer. [Laughs] And he was determined they were going to become social engineers.And from
                    that very first year, and that first class, Charles Hamilton Houston was kind of guiding the strategy of attacking
                    segregation, mainly in the form of Plessy versus Ferguson, which was the Supreme Court case that had established “separate
                    but equal.” My father tells the story that, in that time when he was in college in the 1920s, that you couldn’t even get
                    a law passed against lynching because of the power of the Southern bloc in Congress. And so, that was one of the things that
                    convinced him that it would take something going to the Supreme Court to make a real change. And so, that was part of his
                    motivation, as well.So, when he got out of law school, in 1933, he went back to Roanoke to start to practice. But this was
                    the middle of the Depression, and he was having a hard time making a living, so he started waiting tables to [laughs] earn
                    money.

                    But at the same time, and I can’t remember the name of the person, but there was a white individual from a wealthy family
                    who gave a large donation to the NAACP, which was used to kind of bankroll the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. And so, Charles
                    Hamilton Houston, and Thurgood Marshall, and my father, and several other lawyers were working with the NAACP Legal Defense
                    Fund and starting to look for these cases to gradually assault segregation.

                    And it was a conscious effort on the part of Houston and Mordecai Johnson to do this. So, in the 1930s, one of the first big
                    cases that they had some success with was the school salary case, I mean, the teacher salary case in Virginia. In those
                    days, the highest-paid black teacher had to make less than the lowest-paid white teacher. [Laughs] So, that was kind of an
                    easy case to take, although it took several years before it was finally resolved, and it was in the 1940s, I think, it was
                    finally resolved.But my father, you know, started working in Virginia, and by this time, he had moved back to Richmond. And
                    then, he was in his forties but he got drafted for World War II. [Laughs] And he thinks it was, you know, kind of a
                    conscious decision with the local draft board to try to get him out of their hair. But once he got in the Army, he got to
                    the level of sergeant. He kept pressing for them to send him to Officer Training School as a lawyer. And they would usually
                    transfer him somewhere else before they got to that point.

                    Right. And even in England, he was, again, kicking up a fuss about getting to Officer Candidate School, and that actually
                    caused his unit to be a little bit late, and otherwise he probably would have been in D-Day. But his unit came over a little
                    bit later.

                    Richmond. And he was one of the first blacks—I guess he was the first black to be elected to an office in the deep South
                    since Reconstruction. He was elected to the Richmond City Council.

                    But he did have several other campaigns after I was born, and I do remember those. He ran for House of Delegates and lost by
                    forty votes, I think. It was some really close race in the early fifties. But he was always involved in the Virginia
                    Democratic Party. And so, and even when he was running for city council, he didn’t just confine his race to the black
                    community. He would go around to white communities, knock on doors, and ask them for their vote. So, he was always kind of
                    fearless in that way. [Laughs]

                    And he always attended every meeting, you know, of any kind of political thing that was going on in Richmond. It didn’t
                    matter whether it was conservative or liberal, he would be there, voicing his opinion. And, of course, you know, all this
                    time, they were continuing with the strategy of overturning Plessy. And they finally found some—the cases that they
                    thought were going to be the ones they needed, particularly the Clarendon County case in South Carolina.And it was around
                    that time that he got a call from Barbara Johns in Farmville. And, of course, they were planning to have this boycott, or
                    walkout at their school, because of the conditions.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yeah. Well, Barbara Johns was a high school girl, and the black high school in Farmville was in really bad condition. And I
                    think they were, you know, in some kind of tarpaper shacks out in back for some of the overflow. And the rain would come in,
                    and they would have dripping water on their desks. Anyway, Barbara Johns kind of organized the students to come up with a
                    protest, and they were going to have a walkout and refuse to go back until the conditions had changed.And she called my
                    father to come and represent them, because the school board was, you know, upset about all this. And their parents were
                    upset because, you know, they were kind of in precarious positions. And at this time, my father, you know, they kind of had
                    their plates full, particularly—and they thought they had all the cases they needed for this push to the Supreme Court.
                    But Barbara Johns was so persistent and so organized that he just couldn’t resist her. So, they decided to come and at
                    least visit Farmville and talk to the parents. And, by this time, they had started to change their strategy. When they first
                    started attacking segregation, it was on the basis of “separate but equal,” and no southern state had the resources to
                    have completely equal educational facilities for the black kids. And so, that was the vulnerable point. But by this time,
                    they had decided they were going to change their strategy and start to attack segregation per se.So, in Farmville, that was
                    one of the things he told the parents, because the children organized this meeting with parents and everybody for the
                    lawyers to come in and talk. And one of the things he said was, you know, “This is about desegregation per se, not just
                    about separate but equal,” and kind of let them know what they would be in for. It would be a relatively long fight. But
                    the community was ready to support it. So, that case, Davis v. Prince Edward County, became one of the cases that was part
                    of the Brown package. I guess it was alphabetical, so it was Brown, led by Brown against Stalling.

                    And Vernon Johns, who was in Petersburg for a while, eventually went down to Alabama, and he was at the church right before
                    Martin Luther King came. So, there’s a lot of connections to Virginia to this early civil rights activity. Although most
                    people think the Civil Rights Movement started in the 1950s, but [laughs] you know, thirty years before, they were starting
                    these cases in the court. In fact, ten years before Rosa Parks, my father’s firm had a case with Irene Morgan, and it was
                    the same kind of story: she refused to give up her seat on the bus. This was an interstate bus, and eventually that case led
                    to segregation on interstate transportation being ruled illegal. Yeah. So, yeah, there were a lot of precursors to Martin
                    Luther King in the fifties.

                    Yeah, for sure. And, you know, from the time he left law school until the Brown decision, that was, you know, almost

                    out with attacking “separate but equal” and then eventually attacking segregation itself.And it was interesting because,
                    in those days, because Richmond was segregated, when the lawyers would come through town, they would always stay with us,
                    because [laughs] they couldn’t stay in the hotels downtown. There were a few black hotels around, like Eggleston’s and
                    Slaughter’s, but they usually tended to stay with us. So, there would be these little strategy sessions around the
                    breakfast table, and I would be off in the corner somewhere. But I didn’t know exactly what was going on, but I just knew
                    something important was happening. And, you know, Thurgood Marshall and Bob Carter and some of the other lawyers would
                    always be through town. So, it was an interesting time.

                    Well, they started in the forties, and they continued to be partners through the fifties. And then, Spott Robinson went to
                    Howard to be the dean of the law school and then, eventually, a federal judge there.But one of the things that was
                    interesting was that all the lawyers for the NAACP thought that once the Supreme Court made its decision, that would be it.
                    That would be the law of the land, everybody would comply, and, you know, the country would be changed. And, of course,
                    Virginia led the push for “massive resistance” to resist the desegregation order. And, you know, who knows what kind of
                    effect that had on the country? We probably could be in the post-racial society now, maybe, if that law had been complied
                    with.

                    Well, they were led by members of the Byrd machine here in Virginia. The governor at the time was J. Lindsay Almond. And so,
                    it was at the highest level that this resistance was coming. And, you know, this was kind of unheard of, that governors and
                    state legislatures were going to just defy the law. [Laughs] And so, a whole new set of cases had to start to be put
                    together to try to force compliance. And so, I guess, for the next ten years or so, that was the nature of the cases.I was
                    in one of the first group of students in Virginia to desegregate the schools, and it wasn’t until the 1960s, and so, that
                    was like seven years after the Brown decision. And for most of Virginia, desegregation didn’t come for another five or six
                    years.

                    Well, this was—it wasn’t a specific case, but this was a continual fight that they had. In those days, they had
                    something they called the Pupil Placement Board, and the Pupil Placement Board would decide what schools you would go to.
                    And it was interesting, though, the head of the school board at that time was Lewis Powell, who was a fairly progressive
                    individual. He and my father had a really good relationship. And so, he would always, you know, give my father an
                    opportunity to speak before the school board and before other community groups. So, you know, there was a gradual trickle of
                    black students that were starting to be allowed into the white schools. But it was definitely not integration, and my father
                    would say, “It was desegregation, but not integration,” [laughs] just a token number of students.

                    Yeah. So, you know, I really didn’t want to be [laughs] one of these students who was integrating the schools. I wanted to
                    go to one of the black schools with all my friends. But, you know, it was interesting that it was inevitable, based on what
                    my father was doing. [Laughs] But they would do such ridiculous things as take out yardsticks and measure the distance from
                    one school to another to try to keep kids out. I can remember one friend of mine who wasn’t allowed in Chandler, which was
                    the white junior high school, because Graves, which was the black school, was three feet closer to his house than Chandler.
                    So, there was a lot of that kind of stuff going on.But eventually, you know, we did start to trickle in. And so, I can
                    remember the first day of going to the white junior high school. And my father had been working in the Kennedy campaign, and
                    he got a job at the—was given a job at the Federal Housing Administration during the Kennedy administration, so he was in
                    Washington most of the week these days. And I remember the first day of school, I was given a ride with his new junior
                    partner, who was Henry Marsh, gave me a ride to school that morning. And I was walking up the steps, and it was like the
                    school was deserted out in front. There was nobody, no teachers, no movement, no nothing. It was just me walking up these
                    steps. And then, I went in the principal’s office, and there were other black kids there in the principal’s office. And
                    then, they marched us out, two by two, to the different homerooms. [Laughs] You know, they kind of had us parceled out
                    around the school. So, it was a kind of interesting, surrealistic day.

                    No big backlash on that day. You know, after a while, you started to sort things out. And you would know the kids and the
                    areas where you would tend to get called “nigger,” or, you know, some other problem would happen. And you would tend to
                    avoid those situations as much as possible. And, of course, the black kids mainly, you know, kept together.But over the
                    years, you know, gradually people started to get to know one another. I mean, that class—it was in the seventh grade
                    then—kind of went all the way through high school. And, by the time I got to high school, I was on the football team, and
                    so, you know, the real problem kids were also on the football team. And so, you kind of got to know them, and they got to be
                    teammates. And it was kind of like, you know, the way in which people envision integration working, that you live together,
                    you go together, you kind of acknowledge the humanity that you share. And even those who were most prejudiced at the seventh
                    grade were gradually, you know, starting to become at least friendly, if not friends, by the time we got to high school.

                    Yeah, it is. But by the time I got to high school, or maybe a year or two after I left high school, there was a black girl
                    who was the prom queen in that same school. So, there really was starting to be kind of, even a little bit of social
                    integration in schools. When I was there, it was still pretty much social segregation. We ate together in the cafeteria and
                    we, if we went to a dance at the high school, we would have our area where we would be dancing, and they would have their
                    area. But gradually, that started to change. But, of course, as soon as things started to gradually integrate, then you had
                    the resegregation with white flight with busing that came in the late 1960s. So, you know, had the experiment continued, you
                    know, again, things might be a little different now.

                    Oh, yeah! Once busing was instituted as a remedy. And one other courageous figure at that time was Judge Robert Merhige, who
                    is a local judge here in Richmond, who ordered busing patterns that included the surrounding counties. And, I mean, just to
                    show how these little circumstances led to some really important ramifications, that solution, you know, would have really
                    had a big impact. I mean, we still have this tension between the city and the counties today, as a result—I mean, kind of
                    a leftover from those old racial politics days. And Merhige was—you know, he also got a lot of threats. His dog was
                    killed. You know, his children were threatened. And when the case went to, I don’t know which circuit it was, but it was
                    overturned.And then, it went to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court then, Nixon had just nominated—um, the former
                    chief justice. What was his name? I’m having a senior moment here. Rehnquist! And also, he had tried to nominate Harrold
                    Carswell, but that didn’t—that was blocked by the Senate. And so, he nominated Lewis Powell. And Lewis Powell and
                    Rehnquist got on the bench. They hadn’t heard the original arguments for this case. And Powell, because of his previous
                    association with the Richmond school board, recused himself, and Rehnquist didn’t. [Laughs] And so, the Supreme Court had
                    a four-four split, which meant that the lower court finding was upheld. And so, the inclusion of the counties in the busing
                    plan, you know, fell through. But had Powell not recused himself, or had Rehnquist recused himself, this might be a
                    different world now. [Laughs] But anyway—

                    I’ve done some work in Louisville, which is interesting, because they’ve just—at the same time that they passed
                    busing, they collapsed—they just collapsed county and city government into one, as one way to get around it.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yeah. Because in Richmond, it’s really interesting the way racial politics works. At first, once in the late sixties and
                    early seventies, when you did have this white flight—of course, now you had much more black political power in Richmond.
                    And so, the white political structure in Richmond started to annex territory from the surrounding counties. And that was
                    eventually blocked by the federal government based on the Voting Rights Act, because it was an attempt to dilute the
                    strength of the black vote. So, they couldn’t annex anymore. So, now, you had continued white flight, and now the
                    legislature—once blacks got in power, and Richmond passed the law that Richmond could no longer annex any territory, so
                    it’s landlocked. All the tax base is moving out to the counties.And this is a pattern that you see all over and over again
                    in cities. But Richmond and Virginia is unique, in that usually you do have cities embedded in a county, but in Richmond you
                    have these independent cities. And so, you know, even to this day, the same struggles between the counties and the cities
                    are there. Now, it’s clothed more in class kinds of issues, but it’s—the race issue morphed into a class issue,
                    because you had a lot of black flight, too, black middle class flight.

                    I went to Howard University. And that was an interesting time, too, in the late sixties, because Howard was a hotbed of
                    political activity, and Black Power and African history and all these things that were starting to emerge. And so, you know,
                    for me, it was kind of an eye-opening time. I was fortunate to have, for example, a history class with one of the eminent
                    scholars on African history, whose name just went out of my head, but I’ll think of it in a minute. But I had never heard
                    anything about Africa up until that time, other than Tarzan movies, [laughs] but nothing in terms of African civilizations
                    or any of that kind of thing. So, that was eye-opening.And, of course, there were a lot of, you know, black revolutionaries
                    on campus, Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, and the idea of Black Power. So, there was definitely a change starting to
                    happen then, from Martin Luther King, nonviolent protest, kind of passive protest, the idea of integration to the idea of,
                    you know, kind of Black Nationalism kind of thing among the black intellectuals at Howard.

                    Ah, my mind was—you know, I was kind of persuaded by that argument. I mean, most of it was kind of just rebellion of what
                    I was familiar with, you know. Didn’t want to be a black bourgeoisie anymore, you know. [Laughs] So, you know, that might
                    have held sway for a year or two, but [laughs] gradually, I mean, my thinking kind of moved in other directions. This is
                    when I first started to get interested in Eastern philosophy and meditation and things like that. So, I think that was kind
                    of, you know, I can see it as a continuum of my experience as a child growing up in the segregated South, that you really
                    have to do a lot of introspection and you have to really think about your sense of self, in terms of, you know, these people
                    don’t like me because of skin color, and it causes, you know, a lot of those kinds of self-inquiries to occur.And that
                    continued, and eventually in college, it took a more inward turn. And, you know, I found that some of these books in Indian
                    philosophy really spoke to me. And I wasn’t—I was a history major, but as a senior, I took a course in perception in
                    psychology. And that also had a big influence on me, the idea that in many ways we construct our reality, you know, based on
                    our expectancies and our beliefs and our previous experiences. So, that’s—you know, it was too late to change my major
                    then, but I did go into psychology in graduate school. But in between graduating from university and going to grad school, I
                    studied meditation more and became a meditation teacher, first in Boston and then in Detroit. And that’s—I got to the
                    University of Michigan.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yeah. There was one other point I wanted to make, though, about my early years. When I was in those segregated schools in
                    Richmond, growing up, the quality of the teachers was just amazing. I mean, there were some kind of unintended consequences
                    of integration. I think one of the losses was the quality of the black teachers that we had in those classrooms, women, for
                    the most part. And so, again, this is another kind of confluence of things but, you know, the women’s movement was very
                    big in the sixties, also. And so, at one time, all the best and brightest women went into teaching. And so, now they had
                    wider possibilities, and we didn’t really put anything in place to attract the best and brightest into education anymore.
                    And I think black education has suffered more than the education in general, because of the, you know, these other
                    influences: white flight, tax base erosion, poor resources in the inner cities.I mean, I now work a lot with Petersburg,
                    and, you know, they have the lowest performing schools in the state, because it’s—it’s kind of a desperate situation.
                    They lost their tax base a number of years ago when the tobacco companies moved out. I just saw yesterday they’re getting
                    ready to lose a chemical plant, too. But when you have a school district like that, it becomes this spiraling kind of
                    downward pattern, because even if you get some decent teachers, they immediately get recruited away, because they can make
                    more money at surrounding districts and have half the headaches. And so, it becomes very difficult to recruit people into
                    those kinds of school districts. And administrators—since I started working with the schools in 2005, there have been four
                    superintendents in that time in Petersburg.

                    Yeah, and most of the principals were not given principalships again when things integrated. Yeah. And, you know, the
                    teachers—I mean, for one thing, most of the black educators during the era of segregation kind of saw themselves on a
                    mission, you know, that education was the key for upward mobility, and, you know, that would be driven in. And, again, you
                    didn’t have this kind of class segregation that we have now in the black schools, because kids from the middle class, the
                    lower middle class, everybody was there in the same school. And so, there was this sense of kind of shared values and things
                    that would get inculcated. Whereas, now, you know, the black middle class is out in the suburbs with the white middle class.
                    And so, in the inner city, you mainly have, you know, kind of these hubs of poverty and, you know, lack of role models, lack
                    of resources.

                    Oh, definitely, yeah. I mean, I think that’s one of the main things holding Richmond back is this lack of cooperation

                    say race has anything to do with it these days. But the seeds of this were definitely in the racial politics, you know, even

                    Yeah, Richmond has. We had a succession of governors that have attempted to, you know, kind of add the black story to

                    Virginia history class. [Laughs] And when you read about slavery, [laughs] it was such a benign institution, you know, they
                    were just like family members, you know, everybody loved everybody. And, [laughs] you know, even from my brief experience, I
                    knew that was a lot of crap. [Laughs] But that was what was being taught. And so, you can understand why, you know, the

                    fifty years later.So, I forgot your question, but [laughs]—

                    [Laughs] Well, yeah, I guess they were just kind of active. But, you know, there was a kind of a climate here. There was a
                    willingness to make that sacrifice among the populace. And part of it might have been that Virginia, you know, for all of
                    its problems, was never Mississippi, you know. I mean, even though we had lynchings here and we had problems—again,
                    Barbara Johns got run out of Farmville—you didn’t have that constant kind of violence that you had further in the South.
                    And so, maybe that created a climate where people felt a little safer to come forward and stand up against some of these
                    segregation laws. That’s a possibility anyway.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Well, Monument Avenue was an avenue of monuments to Confederate generals, for the most part. And so, you have—and the
                    statues, you know, are all huge statues, particularly of Robert E. Lee. The statues would be facing a certain direction.
                    They were facing the south if they survived the war. They were facing north if they were killed in the war. So, it’s a
                    very stately street. And so, then the proposal came to erect a statue to Arthur Ashe, and it was decided by the city council
                    to put in on Monument Avenue. And, of course, a lot of people came out of the woodwork, complaining about this, that it was
                    kind of a sacrilege.I mean, it’s so interesting. And I think one of the reasons Virginia is changing is because kind of
                    the old genteel Virginia, which was never as overtly racist as people further south, but it would still rear its head every
                    now and then [laughs] with these kinds of things. I mean, there was a big objection to putting a statue of Lincoln at the
                    Tredegar Iron Works, which was a building left over from the Civil War. But—and this was like ten years ago, fifteen years
                    ago. And you would say, “Objection to a statue of Lincoln, you know, in these days?” It just was unbelievable. But
                    it’s “heritage, not hate,” you know [laughs].

                    which pictures Barbara Johns on one side, and my father and Spott Robinson on one side. And it’s just an acknowledgement
                    of Virginia’s role in the Civil Rights Movement. And, of course, it’s right down from a statue of Harry Byrd, [laughs],
                    so it’s an interesting juxtaposition.And also, they named a building for my father on the capitol grounds, the old Finance
                    Building. And there’s an irony about that, too, because that was the place where Byrd and Almond and some of the others
                    kind of worked out their initial strategy for “massive resistance,” in that same building. And it was also a building
                    where, when my father graduated from law school, he went there to take the bar exam. And, of course, the seating was
                    segregated. And he came in late, and the only seat he saw was upfront, which was in the white section, so he went and sat
                    down there. [Laughs] And so, there was a bit of a row, but I think they eventually let him sit there. And so, all that’s
                    in that same building.

                    Yeah. Well, my whole career has been at Virginia State University, which is a historically black university. So, you know,
                    just kind of being in that environment, you’re reminded of all of this history, because Virginia State and most of the
                    other HBCUs were founded to provide an opportunity for blacks in states to have a higher education. They didn’t want them
                    to come to the white institutions. And, you know, our colors are orange and blue because we used to get hand-me-downs from
                    UVA [laughing] for football and for other things.

                    And, you know, over the years, it’s been interesting to see the politics around, you know, state allocations for higher
                    education with VSU. In Virginia, you know, we have a system that’s unlike many states. I mean, in North Carolina, you have
                    one state system. In Virginia, we have Tech and UVA; and then we have kind of a second-tier now of VCU and George Mason,
                    maybe; and then, [laughs] the rest of us. But, you know, so just being in that setting, you know, just kind of creates a lot
                    of reminders of those kinds of things. And a lot of my research has been done on black education and cognitive factors. And
                    it’s been interesting, you know, looking at this thing about U.S. education and, you know, the thinking from Brown
                    forward, how the current state is really the latest iteration of those same issues that were there fifty or sixty years ago.
                    I mean, now, of course, we know about the effect of nutrition on education and early childhood, medical attention, and
                    cognitive stimulation. I mean, one of the things that is definitely a key element of the lagging of black educational
                    achievement nationwide is this lack of early childhood stimulation. But we know now that these cognitive abilities that in
                    the fifties were thought to be totally fixed, all heredity, we know they’re malleable and that, with the right kinds of
                    experiences, you can start to develop these skills. And that’s been something that I’ve been interested in working with
                    for the last ten or fifteen years or so.And that’s how I got first in contact with the Algebra Project and Bob Moses. And
                    we set up a project in Petersburg, and they came in and—I mean, Bob Moses was an early civil rights leader with SNCC in
                    the 1960s, and he was involved in a lot of the voter registration programs and things that went on in Mississippi. And then,
                    he later got a PhD in math from Harvard, and he was dissatisfied with the way in which his own kids were experiencing math
                    in the Cambridge schools. So, he developed these approaches to teaching abstract mathematical concepts in ways that are
                    based on the experiences, the life experiences of children, and he’s been very successful in doing that.But he also takes
                    a civil rights approach to school reform, in that he uses the same kinds of principles of community organization around
                    support for schools, that it’s not just the schools or the teachers by themselves that can bring about change, but it
                    takes a whole community effort.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yes, you can. I mean, one of the things that we’re always looking for is transfer, like if you work in the cognitive
                    domain, and you’re trying to develop cognitive skills, per se, through practice of things like attention and short-term
                    memory and those kinds of activities, do you get transfer to performance in math or in other things? And we find that you
                    do. You do need content, as well. But it’s like the cognitive training is like building the framework, and then you still
                    need the content to fit into that framework. But without the framework, there’s nothing for the content to adhere to. And
                    so, students in general today tend to—you know, even high-performing students—tend to have all these unorganized
                    concepts that aren’t integrated in any kind of way, aren’t able to do any kind of abstraction from those concepts. And a
                    lot of it is from the lack of that development of the underlying cognitive framework.And, you know, in general there’s
                    kind of been a dumbing-down of education in the country over the years. When I went to Chandler when I was twelve or
                    thirteen, I mean, this might seem just being a parent reality, because of my advancing age, but [laughs] it seems as if the
                    educational rigor was higher than it is with college kids these days, you know, and in terms of both the breadth and the
                    depth of information that we were exposed to. And I think part of that is in terms of the teacher pool. I think part of it
                    is in terms of educational experience. I think part of it is some unintended consequences from well-meaning liberal teachers
                    who didn’t have the right level of expectation for black students. My mother was an educator for years, and I can remember
                    her saying that in the sixties when they started to have the integrated schools that these teachers weren’t holding the
                    kids to the same standards that the black teachers were holding the kids to. And so, there was this—I mean, George Bush,
                    you know, I don’t agree with him on very many things, but he came up with one phrase that I thought was pretty apt. And
                    that was, and I can’t remember the phrase now, but it was something about the “high prejudice of low expectations,” or
                    something like that. And I think that’s true. You know, the self-esteem movement and the social-passing movement—I
                    don’t know if you can call them movements, but they tended to be trends in education—I think have done a lot of damage.
                    And I think a lot of that came from well-meaning people worried about the ability of these poor little black kids in the
                    inner city and what they could and could not do. And most of the studies you read about minority education that works,
                    instead of dumbing down a curriculum to remediate any lacking information, is producing a challenging curriculum, you know,
                    producing something that’s going to stretch their capabilities. And students tend to respond to expectations.

                    It’s extremely challenging. And that’s been one of the problems with a school district like Petersburg. It’s hard to
                    come in and, you know, try to institute some innovation when everything is about the test scores, you know. And, you know, I
                    mean, the curriculum is so drained of any kind of intellectually stimulating content. It’s all about performance on the
                    test. And I think the lower-performing schools, this disproportionately affects them, in terms of how they spend their
                    resources and their time.

                    Umm, let’s see if there’s anything we haven’t covered. I mean, I guess the only thing additionally I would like to say
                    is just that I am optimistic. I do think that we will rebound from all of this. It will just be relatively slow. But we do
                    need to—you know, we are starting to see a little bit of a movement toward innovation in education. And even though it’s
                    an entrenched kind of bureaucracy and it’s going to be slow to change, I think change is inevitable, both for K through
                    Twelve education and higher education. I mean, the university as we know it now probably is not going to exist for that much
                    longer with the, you know, the explosion of online courses and and, you know, whatever the next innovation is going to be.

                    excitement. It definitely wasn’t rote and it wasn’t, you know, something that was just for performance on a test. But

                    Yeah. But I do think that education today is kind of the legacy of the civil rights struggle of the last few years. So, I
                    think this is where the battleground, so to speak, of the continuing struggle is going to be, and that we have to, not only
                    get the political will, but the popular awareness of the need for change. And it’s interesting. A lot of the organizations
                    who were the main movers and shakers in the civil rights era need to change their approach and change their tactics. I mean,
                    now we mobilize when somebody uses the n-word or, you know, there’s national outrage. Where’s the outrage over the
                    conditions that these kids are going to school in, you know? We need that kind of leadership and direction.

                    And the outrage over the disproportionate number of black men in prison.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yes! And I think all these things are related. I mean, the prison-industrial complex and the war on drugs, you know, has
                    definitely related to the collapsing family structures and the educational system in the inner cities. So, it’s like all
                    these things are part of the mix. And we all—you know, the interesting book about the new Jim Crow is about the prison
                    system.
