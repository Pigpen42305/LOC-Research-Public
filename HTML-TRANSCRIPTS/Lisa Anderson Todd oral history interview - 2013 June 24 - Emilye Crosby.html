                2013. June twenty-fourth, 2013 at Ms. Todd’s home in Washington, D.C. Thanks very much for doing the interview with us
                today. Can you tell me a little bit about your family and your early background growing up?

                I’m the daughter of a corporate lawyer. My father was Carl Anderson and my mother was a psychiatric social worker. They
                came from the Midwest after my father got his law degree, to New York City. And we—I grew up in Summit, New Jersey. When
                my father got a corporate job in New Jersey. And I have two older brothers. It was typical 1950s suburban living. My mother
                never worker or she worked one year when I was in eighth grade. Went back to work, but she decided after one year that she
                couldn’t do it all. She had her full responsibilities at home. My father didn’t participate. They were interested in
                public service. I have that example, but they were not particularly liberal. My father was a Republican. He was afraid of
                signing documents because of the McCarthy scare. He remembered that. My mother grew up poor, one of six children in Hibbing,
                Minnesota, and I think that influenced her and influenced me in having an interest in the poor and the excluded, the
                downtrodden, although in growing up I did not participate in any of that. I did not have exposure to local blacks. There
                were blacks in my junior high school, but they were not my friends.

                Hibbing has an interesting history doesn’t it? I mean, there was—I mean I think that part of Minnesota had some strong

                The iron ore mines made facilities available. The Hibbing High School today is a model with a swimming pool. And my mother
                benefitted from that educational experience. She went to Hibbing Junior College and then transferred to the University of
                Minnesota.

                I was influenced to get—to do the kind of work that began me on that journey to Freedom Summer by spending a summer in
                northern Sweden on the Experiment in International Living and I lived in a remote area with a family for one
                month—traveled with a group of ten kids and at the end of that summer, I said, “What do I want to do next summer? Well
                I’d love to go back to Europe.” I was following the example of my older brother, and he had gone on an American Friends
                Service Committee work project in Italy and helped build a school. And I said to myself, “I don’t want a vacation
                because that’s what my Experiment summer was like. Next summer, I want to do something.” I said to myself, “There are
                plenty of problems in the United States. I don’t want to go back to Europe.” And I researched work camps and I was very
                fortunate to be able to sign up for two work camps, the summer of 1963. I participated in a project of the Ecumenical
                Voluntary Service of the World Council of Churches at Tougaloo College. We did maintenance work for the college that had not
                been done before. In the course of doing that, we were learning about the Civil Rights Movement. We went to non-violent
                training workshops. We heard speakers in the Social Science lab, and we had an incredible day on August 1, 1963, going up to
                Greenwood to the SNCC office at the invitation of Bob Moses and going to a mass meeting that evening. We split up—our
                group of ten so—I guess there were three or four of us that went to Ruleville and had a dinner at Fanny Lou Hamer’s
                home.

                And she told the story to us of the beating in Winona and I can remember her saying—and I wrote in my diary that she said,
                “I didn’t know that flesh could be so hard.” And going to the mass meeting that evening was an incredible experience
                for me. We had been to mass meetings in Jackson, but that was so different.

                The reception that we got from mostly women, the welcome, the sense that—and the feeling you had that these people were
                risking so much to want to register to vote, when the sanctions were so severe. The risk of the night rider shooting in
                their homes. The loss of a job, the loss of credit that they needed to run their farm, or whatever. And there they were
                saying to us, “We appreciate your being here and your interest in us,” in a situation where I understand they did not
                know friendly white people. And we were friendly white people. So we were accorded a special attention. We sang “We Shall
                Overcome,” arm-over-arm, holding hands. And it was emotional for me. And then I said, “What am I going to do?” You
                know, these people will expect that I go back home and forget. And I didn’t want to forget because it meant a lot to me. A
                number of the kids in the group, we took off for New Orleans, had a little weekend and one of the women in the project was
                going on to Greensboro, North Carolina, with me. On the— we just happened to be—have signed up for a second American
                Friends Service Committee project and we —there were 18 of us. We lived in the basement of a church. We were there for
                voter registration. We only worked from, I think, five p.m. to nine p.m. House-to-house canvassing. The registrars were
                cooperative, they were right in the neighborhood ready to take the person’s application. There had been demonstrations in
                the spring. People were very receptive to going to register to vote and we were able to register 803 people. Mostly
                Democrats, but some Republicans. And what I gained from that experience was an understanding of my black peers because we
                had a group of—one guy, local guy, Pat Patterson and the girls from Greensboro: Randalynn Johnson, Alfreda Artis, and
                Bunky Dansby. We had a lot of fun. And Karen Pate, the gal from Oregon that I traveled with from Mississippi. It was such a
                contrast to Mississippi and it made me comfortable in the black community.

                We were special in Mississippi. We were white. When I went to a mass meeting in Jackson, our group—I don’t know whether
                it was the whole group of ten students or fewer of us—Spotswood Robinson, the head of the NAACP, was speaking. They sat us
                on the stage. You know, we were the only whites in the crowd. And there was, there was a fear of traveling and being white
                in the black community in Mississippi in 1963. We were being careful and in Greensboro, there was much more freedom. The
                other thing that I was fortunate to do in Greensboro was go to parties and learn about black men. The parties started at 11
                o’clock and we had this—our little group of friends and we got to talk about—when we went back to the church, we were
                all living in the same basement of the church, and it was no big deal. So the summer of ’64, that was not a big deal for
                me. I had kind of done that. I had explored relations with black men and I knew that it was just like relations with white
                men. So it’s no big deal, [laughter] although historically it is.

                Maybe between individual people, but in the larger context. Maybe between individual people it means one thing and in the
                larger context it has a different kind of meaning.

                I think CORE was largely doing the work in Jackson in 1963. I met Dave Dennis there. I remember asking him—I remember
                because I kept a detailed diary that summer—asking him why were children used in the Birmingham demonstrations? Because
                that was controversial at the time. The spring of 1963, when there were the hoses and the dogs were out to stop the
                demonstrators. He said, “We want children to learn about how to stand up for freedom before they learn other things from
                their parents.”

                Memphis Norman was heading the Social Science lab that summer. I regretted that I did not meet Dr. Baranski. He was
                apparently on vacation. I did not meet John Salter, who was not on campus at all, but we spent a lot of time with Ed King
                and I looked at his scarred face and thought that that was related to the tremendous sacrifice he was making to be a part of
                the Civil Rights Movement as a white Southerner from Vicksburg.

                Yes. I read that story in The New York Times before I left home and, interesting story, getting on the plane to fly to
                Jackson by myself, not being a frequent flyer, I looked out my window and the engine was on fire and I didn’t know what
                that meant because I had not been doing a lot of flying. But we landed, not at nearby Teterboro, New Jersey, which would
                have been a problem, but went back to Newark and my parents were still there. That was a moment of truth. You know,
                wouldn’t it be easier to stay home? [Laughter] But we got on another slow flight and I had a lot of time to think about
                what I was getting into. But we—. I went ahead and it was so instructive. We had two, two black students in the group,
                Ivory Phillips, who’s become an educator in Jackson. I’ve seen him recently and Thelma Sadberry, who I understand lives
                in Detroit, but I have not been able to connect with her. We had speakers that came to us in the evening. Timothy Jenkins
                spoke to us about the status of the pending Civil Rights Bill. Jane Shut, a remarkable white woman from Jackson,
                Mississippi, was so impressive, the work that she was doing through the church, through the interracial prayer groups and on
                the advisory council. We had an evening at Dr. Bidel’s home. Alan Chalmers, I think it is, from New York spoke to us. He
                was very pessimistic about when Jackson was going to change and become less of a segregated city because they did not have a
                corporate structure that would influence them from outside, as Birmingham had.

                The federal government had influenced Jackson to stop demonstrating, to stop direct action protests, to move into voter
                registration. They would—as I understood it, there would be a way that foundation money could support SNCC’s voter
                registration work. That that would be less confrontational with the local government. In addition, the NAACP decided to stop
                providing bail for any, for all the demonstrators who were so quickly arrested and so mistreated in jail that they needed to
                get out. Charles Evers had come in to take over for the NAACP and they were beginning demonstrations again, but on a small
                scale and not wanting to be arrested. And in the nonviolent workshops, where CORE people were trying to recruit, they were
                not getting very good participation and the explanation, possibly, is that the students had been so mistreated in jail that
                they were not ready to go back and demonstrate again, knowing that they were not going to be getting out quickly. The bail
                had been doubled in the amount.

                I didn’t have much contact with local people. I remember, or I have read in my diary about Dr. Bidel’s position that
                people were critical of the NAACP coming in as outsiders, distinguishing their approach from that of CORE and SNCC, which
                who came in and lived in the community, and stayed in the community and became a part of the community, and took the same
                risks that the community was taking. And that that was more effective a strategy to encourage local people to register and
                participate.

                Well and it’s interesting because of course in—. My understanding is that the North Jackson youth branch of the NAACP,
                which was working with John Salter and Medger Evers and Ed King was really crucial, so that there is a real split between
                the local NAACP, especially the youth, and the national organization and so I don’t know if you have heard anything about
                that at the time.

                He was on campus one day and we were anxious. We heard about SNCC, one of the first days. But I’m not sure who it was now
                that was on campus where the—that was on campus. And Bob Moses did not want to speak to our group because he had to leave.
                There was a dance that evening at the student center. Bob Moses was at the dance and I was very annoyed that he wouldn’t
                talk to us. But it was natural for a—for him to invite us to see the SNCC headquarters. That was where all the work was

                done that. I think she registered to vote in 1962, in the spring. I described her as a short, fat woman with her hair

                Cornell was a difficult adjustment for me, because I had been at an all-girls independent day school in Summit for four
                years and here I was thrown into this huge university by myself. And I did not find the people I expected in my immediate
                living surroundings on—in the dormitory—my first semester. I was unhappy. Second semester, I pledged a sorority and
                found a group of very interesting women, diverse women. Our sorority was pledging Jewish girls at a time when the national
                did not expect that to be the case and it turned out after I left that as a result of that, the Kappa Alpha Theta at Cornell
                lost its charter and went local, with the support of the Cornell administration. But because of rushing Jewish girls, and
                avoiding the requirements of getting two references, one from any Theta alum and one from the alum from the girls’
                hometown, they stopped rushing the year after I left.

                And the summer of ’63, I felt also, I was not an activist. I was learning about the movement. It was very easy, and so I
                talk in my diary about making a commitment. And that’s what we talked about then. Which side are you on? Because it was

                That decision was very easily and quickly made when I came home. Pat Vale and I travelled by bus from Greenville to Summit,
                New Jersey. Not asking for help from my parents at any point. We took the local bus from Newark to Summit and I knew there
                was a taxi, the Geddess taxi was right across the street from the bus stop at the train station and we took the 75 cent taxi
                with our luggage to, the one mile to our house and my father greeted me at the door. And I said, “Where’s mother?” And
                he said, “She’s not feeling well. She’s learned that you are planning to stay in Mississippi.” And I said, “I’ll
                go to Stanford.” What happened was three students from Greenville went back to New Jersey to recruit delegate support for
                the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party convention challenge, and they talked to the press and the—. A reporter asked,
                “Are any of the students staying in Mississippi after the summer project?” And they said, “Yes, Lisa Anderson is.”
                My mother read that in the paper and she was upset. She was, at that point, very worried about my safety and I couldn’t
                take that. [Laughs]

                The next door neighbor particularly. My mother didn’t want—didn’t want to see her because she was afraid she would
                bring up the subject of my being in Mississippi. They did form a parent’s group and I think that was helpful. And also,
                one of my closest friends in high school from a wonderful family, the Sheffland family in Short Hills. Her younger sister
                Nancy was a volunteer in Greenville and my mother, I think, spent time talking to Mrs. Sheffland and comparing notes.

                I went late. My graduation was on Monday, the 15th, and I stayed an extra day to go to a friend’s wedding on campus in
                Sage Chapel. I think it was the first wedding I had ever been invited to by friends and so I thought that was important and
                I thought, of course, I knew a lot of what was going to be happening at orientation. Cornell sponsored a project in Fayette
                County, Tennessee, Tent City. So there was group of students driving to Fayette County and I got a ride with them and was
                dropped off in Oxford. And I think I arrived on Wednesday.

                like in Mississippi, that the word had not reached the rest of the country and it would be our job to tell the stories in

                We were lectured to about nonviolence. I remember Vincent Harding being so impressive. The way he speaks and I found his
                remarks are on the internet, of what he actually said. We were—I believe it is he, it might have been Bruce Hanson, who
                reminded us of our own prejudices, that we had to face the fact that even though we were going in this great spirit of,
                there is no difference, black people and white people, that we might ourselves have innate prejudice. I remember the
                role-playing we did in nonviolence outside on the lawn. It was a great relief to get outside that auditorium and the
                reporters and the cameramen participated. And I have—I had a—I have a note in the postcard I sent home to my parents, I
                guess, that—or else I only have it in my memory, but it is a distinct memory that Carl Fleming of Newsweek punched me in
                the stomach.

                And I, of course, played the role of victim not aggressor. And I understand the second week of orientation there was very
                little, if any, role-playing of nonviolence because the mood, of course, that week changed entirely after the disappearance
                of what I’ve always called the three boys. That’s the way we talked about the three boys. But now everyone, its, I think
                is very familiar with the fact Chaney—all black—Schwerner, a staff, core staff person, and Goodman, a volunteer just
                like me. Not just like me of course, disappeared that Sunday, June 21. That Saturday they disappeared. The day that I
                arrived in Mississippi.

                I think I ended up there because I was going to be in voter registration and because I had had that specific experience in
                Greensboro and not that I particularly asked for it. And it was dangerous for women—black or white—to be in the fields
                in most areas of Mississippi. Greenville is noted as being a relatively moderate city.

                among—conversation a few years back was a discussion of attitudes about working in the field and voter registration work
                versus Freedom School teaching. Did you have any sense of that at the time, with status of one or the other?

                I felt that I had status. I felt that I had—that I was privileged because I was able to have more exposure to black
                families, black adults. To be approaching their homes, not that I was invited inside often. But I had an opportunity to talk
                to adults. Whereas the Freedom School teachers were dealing more, I think, in Greenville with young children. I felt that I
                knew more about the politics of civil rights than the Freedom School teachers who I think, they were all white women.

                other was James Williams.

                George Rowell was our project director. He was from the University of Chicago. He was a graduate student, I believe, and he
                was there for the first month and then Muriel Tillinghast became the project director. I never knew—. I knew that George
                was our project director and I thought that he was not, he was not in the SNCC mode of working slowly. He was approaching
                this as a project, as a project that he was going to be the director of. But I always thought that Charlie Cobb was our
                project director. [Laughs]

                What was it like? I felt safe. I felt less at risk. I did not feel that courageous, what I was doing. We moved in the black
                community freely. We never went to the white community. There was no reason to. And it was hot. Just—we tried to canvass
                at any time of the day, all day long. We lived in community. That was, that was the most—probably the most
                significant—one of the most significant parts of the summer for me, to be living with a black family.

                I lived in the south end. Well the first, the first couple of days, the first day, I slept on the floor of the Freedom
                House. There was no housing, but I was confident that Charlie could work this out for us. And there was nothing I could do
                about it, of course, either. There were three of us stuck together, I think, the whole summer. Valerie and Lynn and I, and
                they were both in research, whereas I was in voter registration. We got a place to stay with a widow who lived alone across
                the street in a house that was just like the Freedom House. And we probably shared a bed in the front room and I looked
                forward to taking a bath after a night on the road. We had driven—. I had gotten a ride, I didn’t go on the bus from
                Oxford and we had slept overnight at a house in Memphis and the next night I was sleeping on the floor in the Freedom House.
                And as soon as—. I mean I can see the depth of the water in the bottom of the tub and the woman yells, “Don’t use too
                much water!” We were out of there in a couple of days. She decided that she did not want the risk of having three white
                women staying in her house. We went to the home of a woman who I think was more independent. She had a veterans pension
                income and social security. Her daughter was living with her and she was wonderful. I just wanted to sit at her kitchen
                table and hear her stories and talk to her.

                Mrs. Harden, I think. And there was a boy in the neighborhood. We went to church with her, and there was a boy in the
                neighborhood who said, “The Uncle Toms are trying to run her out of church because she took you to church.” And I
                thought that was terrible. We—I moved from there, because that was in the south end and our voter registration office was
                on Nelson Street in the north end and the three of us lived with Jerry and Lamar Britton and they had a large brick
                air-conditioned house. And Valerie and I had a double-bed room on the first floor. And this place was open house for us. It
                was wonderful.

                Pretty much neutral. Non-committal and not interested. You know, life is okay. Status quo. There wasn’t a strong response.
                What it turned into, very quickly, was not voter, typical voter registration. “We want you to go to courthouse to
                register,” but to—but freedom registration for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which was the alternative. So I
                had a clipboard with—. And I have a picture of me carrying the clipboard. Some photographer was behind Pam and me one day
                and took a picture. A great picture. “Would you register for the Freedom Democratic Party?” And fill out this form and
                anybody could register. You were not required to be literate even, just to be able to sign your own name. And we had to
                explain the Freedom Democratic Party so that would be, that would be the nature of my canvassing.

                Yes, yes. We had to assure people that this was not going to become public knowledge. And unlike voter—unlike
                applying—an application for voter registration, you didn’t just register to vote, you had to apply and qualify through
                the literacy tests, including the interpretation of the Mississippi State Constitution provision that happened to be given
                to you to the satisfaction of the registrar, who had complete discretion and then publicity of your name in the newspaper,
                the local newspaper for two weeks to test your moral character? That meant everyone knew who was seeking to register to
                vote. That was such a deterrent I think for people.

                We were more apt to get somebody to sign that Freedom registration form by saying, “This form is not going to go anywhere.
                We are going to keep the form.” I think that would still be a risk for somebody. But that was—that was our
                accomplishment, was to go back to the office with signed Freedom registration forms.

                I have no recollection. I guess, I guess it was probably Pat, who filled in. Pat was—went down from—she had been working
                as a legal secretary, as a secretary in the law school at Harvard when she heard about the Mississippi Summer Project and
                applied and she was assigned to be a Freedom School teacher. But she knew how to type, so she became the Freedom secretary
                and worked in the office. And she would have kept track of that kind of thing.

                That is why we went out as a team, as a black and white team. We did not want people to agree to register just because it
                was a white asking for that to be done and to—for them to defer to an authority figure.

                with black men and so that that wasn’t a big deal for you in the summer of ’64. Do you remember it being an issue on the

                The only—no, no. The only thing I remember in terms of what about the sex on the project is that one of the white
                volunteers left and the word was that she was pregnant and she left with a black volunteer. Now how she knew that fast that
                she was pregnant, I don’t know.

                Yes. We were—there were six precincts in Greenville, where we elected precinct delegates and I was in charge of one of
                those precincts and we had—we didn’t just have a precinct meeting, but we had a workshop before the precinct meeting for
                people to understand what the process was going to be. And I canvassed with Mr. Williams the day of the workshop, I believe.
                And maybe we had 12 people at his house or at a neighbor’s house. But at the precinct meeting we got 20 people and I
                thought that was pretty good, although I had been scornful earlier in the summer when Freedom school teachers came back from
                an NAACP meeting, saying that they were ready to move and that there were 20 people there. I thought the NAACP is not
                moving. We need to find new people who will be more aggressive [phone rings] working towards civil rights.We—at the
                precinct we elected delegates to the county convention and then I went to the county convention and was very interested in
                the way that was conducted because there was a local man, Mr. Chapel, who was active in the Democratic Party I think, who
                decided that he could run this meeting better than the neophytes, the new people coming in to politics that had been
                recruited by the MFDP. And he tried to get a chairman elected and that didn’t work, but then he moved that all the
                precinct delegates who were present should be elected county delegates. And managed to get that seconded and passed. And
                this is local people who are looking to their traditional leaders, intending to listen to them, as opposed to thinking about
                what the alternatives are and pushing for an alternative. And so my—what I noted in a letter home was he got a strange
                bunch in there and there were some people that were very strong with the MFDP that we had been working who were then elected
                county delegates. The comment that I got from a couple women at the end of that meeting was, “They step in at the end, but
                where were they when we were doing all the work?” They were resentful and I was glad to hear that expression of opinion
                because that was my opinion.

                I don’t remember specifically, but the district caucus was not electing delegates, but was coming up with a recommended
                list of delegates that would be, that would go to the state convention and the state convention would actually elect the 68
                delegates who would go to the National Convention in Atlantic City, and I believe then at the district caucus I was pleased
                that Mr. Chapel did not get recommended as a delegate. I was afraid that he would undercut the new MFDP people.

                I had the sense of it. Let me interject one thing about—that I should have said about Charlie Cobb. What he told us to do
                was to, in all of our recruiting for voter registration, to work around the local leaders and it dawned on me later that
                what he was saying was that we were to be finding new voices and that, and allowing new people to stand up and speak up on
                their own behalf rather than continuing to defer to established—the established leadership. That is what we now call
                empowerment. We were empowering people, and I don’t think we ever used that word. And it’s just like, well, everything
                you read now about the beloved community. We never talked about the beloved community, that we were living in that near
                ideal state of where class and race and economic status make no difference, that we are all apart of the human family.

                No. It comes from Martin Luther King, far earlier, that he—that he wrote about it as the outgrowth of nonviolence and

                They were. I wondered what their status was. They were—. They appeared to be SNCC staff. They were assigned by COFO,
                Jackson to Greenville. They were, I think, both new to the community, college students. And they were—. They spoke
                anti-Bob Moses. That he doesn’t know, he doesn’t know what’s going on. You know, he’s on his way out of the
                movement. That they knew, you know, what needed to be done. We had a demonstration the first week on the project. We—and
                this was instigated by the local chapter of the Mississippi Student’s Union, the high school students—. They wanted to,
                after we heard about the disappearance of the three civil rights workers, they wanted to demonstrate for federal protection.
                And we picketed at the federal building, mid-day, and I prepared to be arrested for the first time. And had my toothbrush or
                something in my pocket. And nothing happened. The police looked on, the passersby looked on. We were out there for a couple
                of hours, but we were clearly instructed during orientation not to demonstrate. And when Bob Moses in Oxford heard that
                there was a demonstration in Greenville he said, “That’s not true. That couldn’t be.” I have that in one of my

                But what I was leading to was—. These two fellows wanted to have a demonstration the next week. You know, they wanted to,

                opposed to that. You know, I thought we—maybe we could tell Jackson that we wanted to do it and if they, if COFO in
                Jackson said, “Okay,” then that would be okay, but we should not do that.

                the subject of one of the letters from Mississippi that Barbara Mutnick wrote.

                The same, I think. That was also for federal protection. The idea was that if local people wanted to demonstrate, were we
                going to say, “Oh, we can’t do that?” Or were we going to support them because we wanted their support.

                Do you remember, were there discussions with sort of longer term COFO staff about the first demonstration or the second one

                We had long discussions about whether to demonstrate and whether we should apply for a permit and one of these fellows
                called up the police chief and said we are going to be there in 15 minutes, [phone rings] so that’s how that was decided
                [laughs]. But, okay—.

                I mean I know that there were tensions in Greenwood about demonstrations and sort of SNCC was being called conservative for
                not wanting to demonstrate in Greenwood that summer. That exact tension that you describe. So are there other things that
                stand out for you from that summer that you remember?

                Well one—. Somebody asked me once what did we do for fun? I had to think about that. What was fun during that summer? I
                felt that I was working very hard, that I was very committed to this work. And the, one way to respond to that was, well,
                somebody else said it to me first, but what I enjoyed was sitting in one of these cafes over a meal sharing a quart of beer
                and talking, in a group. It wasn’t going to be Charlie Cobb, he never joined our group, and I don’t know who the
                interesting local blacks were, because it wasn’t just us white volunteers there, but just to talk about what are we doing?
                What should we be doing? What’s going on? Not that we were great strategists or anything and could influence things, but
                we were so involved in the issues of civil rights the—. We had one event on the Fourth of July. Dr. Frisbee who was the
                prominent doctor in town, invited the, all the project volunteers, and I think there were 35 of us, to his home for a
                picnic, a barbecue picnic and the neighbors were there. That was a very nice occasion where we got to see one another,
                because we had separated throughout the city. And answer questions from the, from local people. These were the middle class,
                well to-do established people in Greenville. But the other thing, when I’ve contacted the volunteers recently that we all
                remember is the time that we were invited to swim in Hodding Carter’s pool. And we were—. This was Dorothy Jones and she
                asked me if I would liked to stay overnight because the Carters were going out of town and she didn’t want to be alone
                with the baby. And then, bring along some people and you can swim. Well it quickly turned into the whole project going over
                to swim. And we—. The girls I’ve talked to were trying to remember, we didn’t go down to Greenville with our bathing
                suits, how did we, what did we do? One person thought that they had bathing suits that we could use in the pool house and
                somebody else said we probably just stripped down and swam in our shorts and our clothes and this was delightful. Suddenly,
                the party was broken up by two or three men riding into the property on horseback and apparently the neighbors thought
                something strange was going on and they were there to protect the Carters and we quickly disbanded, got back to the project
                somehow, with whatever little transportation that we had. But Barbara and Nancy did stay overnight and they would never do
                this in somebody’s house, but they opened the drawer of the nightstand by the bed and there was a revolver in there.
                Barbara wrote in a letter that the place was fully armed. It was like an arsenal.

                Right he—. What’s interesting about Johnny Frazier that I learned from, I think I learned from Hodding Carter, if
                somehow I put together Johnny Frazier, who I met in 1963—. He spoke to our group besides speaking at a mass meeting that
                we went. He was the head of the NAACP Youth Chapter, that he was from Greenville. And he was—. When he was a student at
                Coleman High School, he wore a black armband to school because of the Brown versus Board of Education decision in mourning
                that they were not doing anything about it. Or whatever his theory was, but he was suspended. And Hodding Carter apparently
                wrote an editorial about this, and they met, but he was allowed back into the school because his aunt said that, well,
                they’d sue to integrate the white high school if they wouldn’t let him back into the black one. So they let him back
                in.

                But his daughter, I think, Neshani Frazier is at Miami University and she’s been a sponsor of the reunions and I saw him

                you the Johnny Frazier from Greenville and Jackson?” And I told him that I was trying to write up my story in retirement

                I decided early on that I wanted to go to the convention and because Atlantic City is just a couple of hours from Summit, it
                would be feasible. So Pat and I went to our house, stayed overnight and drove down to Atlantic City and missed entirely
                Saturday—Fanny Lou Hamer’s testimony. Didn’t see it on television. We did have a television at that time. And stayed
                in the church of, Union Baptist Temple Church, where the meetings were held of the MFDP delegation. Slept there and spent
                our days walking on the boardwalk talking to delegates, urging them to vote, to seek the MFDP delegation. Or we were
                participating in the vigils and the rallies outside convention hall.

                of—do you have an official role there? Is there any kind of effort by the project to decide who’s going to be there and

                To work with their state delegations. Now I had three people doing that in New Jersey, who left the project early to go back
                to find New Jersey delegates. Now I didn’t know any Democratic, any delegates, Democratic delegates to the convention. So
                I didn’t feel that I had that role and the other thing that’s interesting is that Pat and I didn’t make any effort to
                find a role for ourselves. We were freelance. We just—we knew what we were supposed to do, was to get the delegation
                seated however we could. But we didn’t look for the organizer of that effort and I have learned that Ella Baker was really
                putting together the state delegation support from the Washington office of the MFDP and Eleanor Holmes was working with
                her, particularly after she finished writing the brief for Joe Rauh. And Eleanor told me last month or whatever, when I
                interviewed her that Ella said to her, “I really don’t want to do this to organize the lobbying operation. Would you do
                it for me?” So she was at the Gem Hotel where the delegation stayed and where Sharlene Kranz, young SNCC volunteer
                secretary from, in Washington, was organizing the transportation to get the delegates out to meet state caucuses and
                individual members of the credentials committee to get support. Pat and I never went to the Gem Hotel. We never—. I had
                never even heard of the Gem Hotel when I was there. But we were at the church, we were doing our own thing walking around on
                our own and we, every time we heard there was a meeting at the church, we went to those open meetings. So that was Tuesday
                afternoon, after the credentials committee voted the symbolic two seat offer and on Wednesday after the convention adopted
                the credential committee’s decision. And the Johnson administration wanted the delegation to reconsider its refusal of
                that offer. And I—we couldn’t get a seat, there were so many people. Because I can remember standing in an outside
                aisle, listening to this fascinating discussion where these prominent, prominent people were saying this is a great deal.
                Take the deal. This is fabulous. And they called it “the compromise.” It was no compromise, because there were not two
                sides, each with a position that came together and each side gave up something and they reached an agreement. There was no
                agreement.

                Correct. Absolutely. There was nobody there. What I’ve learned is that the credential committee supporters, the last
                supporters, that came on Tuesday afternoon after the vote and I think Edith Green apparently spoke, and I distinctly
                remember that Martin Luther King was not allowed to speak, that he was hushed, hushed out. But they met separately and they
                agreed to keep their discussions confidential.

                Okay, what the project is—what happened. When I retired in April 1, 2006, seven years ago, and I retired in order to write
                something that was more interesting than what, than the writing I had been doing in my work, and I talked to a couple of
                people who are writers, friends from high school and they asked me questions like whose your audience? What’s you purpose?
                Why are you doing this and they suggested, and this was good advice I think, to write a memoir, to write it as fast as I
                could from my memory, and to get my letters transcribed and my diary also transcribed. And I had a former secretary who was
                able to do that for me. And so by August 1 I had something.

                Because what I wanted to—the reason I wanted to write was not to write a memoir about my story of what I did during the
                Mississippi Summer Project, but I wanted to write about the MFDP Convention Challenge to find out why we lost. What
                happened? What was going on? Because I didn’t understand it and I left disillusioned. That’s when the questions got hard
                about, you know, what are you trying to do? And I couldn’t explain myself very well so I proceeded along this memoir
                route, and I only read Taylor Branch’s summary of what happened in Atlantic City and I got it. I got an idea. But then I
                started reading more and got confused with the sequence of events and my first research, I think, was at UNC at Anne
                Romaine’s oral interviews. And that made me want to do more. Then my niece was getting her Ph.D. at the University of
                Texas and so I went down and stayed with them and went to the LBJ Library and learned about the Johnson tapes of his
                conversations, that you can listen to very easily on the internet and that was incredibly eye opening. And then I just kept
                working on the story of Atlantic City. I produced a research paper that—250 pages called “New Perceptions: Atlantic City
                Revisited”—and Hodding Carter read it and was impressed, but he said it needs, it really needs editing. [Laughs]

                No, I think it was repetitive and all over the lot and I was hurrying. I was—I wanted to get something done, to get
                something circulated. I wanted to send it to some people to read and I was going to have surgery in March of 2008 and I
                swear I sent it in the mail the day before I went to New Orleans for surgery. So then I tried to put both stories together.
                And then I got told I had a hybrid that didn’t work either way and then I kept pursuing it. And so—. But I did more and
                more research and then our friend John Dittmer advised me that the writing that he read required footnotes. So that’s been
                my last effort to footnote all the material and in the course of doing that, to realize the omissions. The things that I

                Johnson opposed the seating of the Freedom Democrats because—. The traditional answer is that he was afraid of losing
                Southern electoral votes and afraid of losing the election to Goldwater, who was the most frightening man that could
                possibly have become president of the United States. And it’s more than that though that I’ve discovered because the
                riots had begun in Rochester and Harlem that summer already, the summer of 1964, and the term backlash was in our lexicon
                and Johnson did not want the election to be about race. That would have been the only way he could have lost, or come close
                to losing, and it was a fear of losing white votes throughout the country. And he did not want any black delegates on the
                floor of the convention. And he didn’t want that in part on the advice of his friend Governor John Connolly of Texas, and
                he did not want to lose his Texas votes and he was already in trouble because he had supported the Civil Rights Act of
                1964.

                The challenge would not have gone forward without Rauh. He was critically important. He claims that he lined up the state
                delegates support, he and his politically savvy people, not the SNCC workers like Frank Smith and Reggie Robinson and Leslie
                Macklemore, who were working out of the Washington office that summer. He did a brilliant job at the credentials committee
                hearing. The sequence of testimony, of course, the most effective part of the hearing was Fanny Lou Hamer’s testimony. But
                he argued and obtained the large ballroom. The administration intended they were going to be in a small room, with maybe
                television coverage and he was able to get that out of the administration. He held out through Sunday, when he thought he
                had the votes, he claimed he had the votes for a minority report, so he was able to cause the delay. He definitely had two
                roles. He was not 100 percent for the Freedom Democrats. He was—. The other part of him was for himself and his role
                within the Democratic Party. What I found astounding was that he offered to withdraw in a letter to the White House, but he
                said, “but I advise that I not withdraw because then it would be run by the commies,” meaning Bill Kunstler and Arthur
                Kinoy would become counsel for the Freedom Democrats at the convention. And he could keep things under control.

                The national Democratic Party did not want—. The main thing they did not want a floor fight. A floor vote by all the

                South for segregation.

                Yes. He wanted to change the party. He wanted the reform and when the reform would take place and how it would take place
                and whether the Freedom Democrats would be seated, they had to have, to make the change in the party, they had to have a
                vehicle and the Freedom Democratic Party was a vehicle to make the challenge and to force the leadership of the party to do
                something. Walter Reuther was never enthusiastic about the challenge and he was close to Johnson and he saw a political
                problem that Rauh did not see in a sense at the beginning.

                Courtland Cox has been very open about the request that Charles Diggs, who was a member of the credentials committee,
                prominent liberal Democratic congressman from Michigan. Diggs requested the list of members of the credentials committee
                that supported the MFDP and he made that request of Bob Moses and Cortland Cox. And Moses was reluctant and Cox said,
                “What do you mean? Do you think he is—. Of course, you know, we want to show our support. Diggs can then show the
                chairman, Lawrence, of the committee our support.” And there were, I think they say, 15 people on the list and that list
                was handed over. I’m not sure if it was Sunday night or Monday night, but overnight, calls were made to all the people on
                the list and they were threatened with some loss of privilege or something if they didn’t change their votes, support the
                administration instead of the MFDP. The list is not very significant. The most you can say is what Michael Thelwell has said
                to me is the names kept changing. Two weeks before the convention, Larry O’Donnell, I think I have got that right. Anyway,
                Johnson aides were researching everybody on that—

                When you asked about what I learned about the convention challenge from research. What I tried to do was set up my proposed
                book to tell the story day-by-day because so many writers confuse what happened and that really changes the way the Freedom
                Democrats look. The way the delegates look and I’m trying to give them more credit, that they deserve. A lot of the
                emphasis is on Hubert Humphrey, and that he worked out a comprise and he did that because he wanted to become Vice President
                and Johnson put him up to do this even though he was a friend of the Civil Rights Movement. And that’s true in many ways,
                but Hubert Humphrey only acted on Monday. And he didn’t succeed. What he did also on Monday was he had his staff people
                running around to all the state delegations to make sure the state delegations would no longer support getting a role call
                vote. That they would go with the Johnson administration telling the state delegations: “Look, you’re a friend of
                Humphrey. You want Humphrey to be Vice-President. In order for him to get the nomination, we have to please Johnson and this
                is what Johnson wants.” So Humphrey was not totally unsuccessful on Monday. But it all happened because of Walter Reuther
                who arrived on Tuesday in the middle of the night. And he worked with the Mondale subcommittee to come up with the finals,
                what Bob Moses calls the symbolic two seat offer that the delegates would be at large and that they would be individually
                named people. And it was Reuther’s manipulation and plan on Tuesday that made what Johnson wanted work. And it
                wasn’t—. Because Humphrey wasn’t getting it done and Reuther had to, the good negotiator, and Humphrey says, “We
                called him in because we needed him.”

                So when Humphrey wasn’t able to make it work on Monday through actually sitting down and talking with people. Then he
                calls in Reuther for a whole other level of arm twisting and deception. Manipulation.

                The leadership is listening to what the offer is and refusing to accept it. But Humphrey did not have the power to negotiate

                Right. The day before their—. Johnson told the press that he would be having a press conference in the middle of the
                afternoon and it would be full press conference with camera. The press is saying how come? Just because the governors are
                here for a meeting are you going to talk about the convention? Are you going to talk about your Vice Presidential nominee?
                And he, you know, no answer. But it was mysterious. So he was ready when he was watching the credentials committee
                testimony. He was ready to cut it off.

                I believe that’s the way we have to characterize it. That he certainly knew that the, you know, that the committee hearing
                was scheduled. But everyone has written about it because of what Joe Rauh said. Joe Rauh told Anne Romaine that Johnson
                suddenly called a press conference. So everybody says hastily called, hurriedly called.

                points are before I really start talking about the book. But what I’ve done is just try to lay it out in what I fear many
                people would find is pretty dull writing. But just day-by-day and then I interject what I was doing and John Dittmer says
                that that adds to the story, that makes it more interesting. But I think by proceeding with my story of what I did
                organizing the MFDP in Greenville is—and how I got involved in the Mississippi Summer Project just makes you
                understand—makes the reader understand, I hope, why I care, why this is important to me. And its—and I want to set the

                upset at the idea that you might stay and that helped you make the decision to go to law school. So what was it like to
                leave Mississippi or the convention challenge and start law school immediately in a whole other world?

                Well it wasn’t immediate. I probably I had the three weeks at home to, you know, get packed and get oriented to go. One
                thing we did during that time, was we had a fundraiser at the Central Presbyterian Church in Summit. And Mr. Schwerner and
                Chip Sauerwine, who was a neighbor who was a volunteer in Drew, Mississippi, I think, and I spoke to a crowd of 600 people I
                think who wanted to hear about the Mississippi Summer Project, even though it’s a very Republican town, but there was so
                much press coverage during the summer, they were interested. And the minister there had sent me a contribution earlier in
                the summer I know of. Because I had a couple of articles in the local newspaper. And we—we raised—I asked and they
                agreed that that money would go for, to support the Herbert Lee Memorial Freedom Center, which was another project I got
                involved in in Greenville at the end of the summer. We relied on all these established leaders that I was calling Uncle
                Tom’s to now support, organize, fund a new community center that would be available to continue the COFO programs after
                the summer. And I went to a couple of meetings and we got the help of a couple volunteer lawyers and because the Delta
                ministry was coming in, they were able to make a contribution and Dr. Matthew Page became the president and he was one of
                the important people for us during the summer. I hoped that he would be one of our new leaders. He was a young doctor, just
                pretty much starting his practice in Greenville. Local. Local man, grew up in Greenville and he, I found out later, became
                the president of the Herbert Lee Memorial Community Center, which was established, not in a new building as we planned with
                a volunteer lawyer but they purchased, no they rented or whatever, they acquired somehow, a church and adapted it, renovated
                it for a meetings and that became a Head Start center and is no longer in use. But the vice-president of that new Herbert
                Lee organization was Charles Moore, who had become active with us and he became a member of the city council for many, many,
                years. And I did not have a chance to talk to him before he died, but I talked to his widow.

                That was just an aside because that’s what I—. The only thing I did when I got back home was related to that. I drove
                across the country to Stanford, to law school. I lived on campus in a brand new apartment building for graduate housing with
                Karen Davis, whose younger sister is Linda Davis who’s a volunteer in Ruleville, Freedom School teacher who was at Oberlin
                College and had decided to stay for a year. So this was a wonderful connection and Karen’s younger, second younger sister
                was a freshman at Stanford and she’s now I think—. I think she’s now a judge in San Francisco. But that—that was a
                nice, nice to be able to continue the connection through the Davis’s.

                Coincidence. Coincidence. I believe it was coincidence. Karen was a second year law student. The Law Student Civil Rights
                Research Council I got involved with that on campus. We had meetings, we had a small group we raised, we tried to raise
                money. There was a dean that was supportive. I found in my papers that I went to Berkeley once for some kind of an event and
                met Arthur Kinoy there. But then I wanted to go back to Mississippi as a law clerk and so I applied and I was selected and
                assigned to the lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and about exam time I was invited by James Danaher to his
                office to talk about Mississippi, because he and one of his partners were going down for a month, I think, or two weeks or
                three weeks, soon with the Lawyer’s Committee. And I didn’t know—. I mean this was a Friday afternoon, I was relaxed
                and I couldn’t believe the naiveté of these men as I was trying to describe my experiences in Mississippi. Soon I learned
                Bill Robinson, with the Law Student Civil Rights Research Council in New York that I would be reassigned. [Laughs]

                No, it was a natural transition. So, Bill told me to go to Jackson, to go somewhere, I don’t know where I was supposed to
                go, he would find another assignment. So I was assigned to the National Lawyer’s Guild and I lived in Tougaloo with

                coordinating groups of volunteer lawyers who came to Mississippi to evaluate the need for litigation to open Title III
                public facilities.

                That was, I think, why I mentioned that about my father. Yes, although, you know, we certainly heard the lecture at
                orientation from Bob Moses that red baiting was a thing of the past. He was—. Regardless of what the National Council of
                Churches said, he was accepting legal services from anyone. He was accepting help from anyone and he wasn’t going to be
                influenced that the movement was going to be tarred with the label of communist. And I remembered that during the summer,
                that when we were called communist that that was just red baiting, that was to be dismissed. We were—. We weren’t
                communist. We weren’t socialist. We were the Civil Rights Movement and it was straightforward and honest and real. When I
                was assigned to the guild, whatever reservation I might have had, later becoming a lawyer and all that, I was an employee
                directly of the Law Student Civil Rights Research Council. I never joined the guild as an attorney. I joined in retirement.
                [Laughter]And at the beginning of May I was in Detroit and I saw Claudia Markham and we had a wonderful, wonderful reunion
                with John Hardy, who she knows in her building. We had a long luncheon, but she told the story, which I had no recollection
                of, that one day, I came out of the bathroom, I said I think there’s a peeping Tom out there. And she yelled Lisa get the
                gun! [Laughter.] Of course, we had no gun.

                You know, I mean, I had, I’ve—. There are people who have read my drafts and say what is this? How did you not know that
                there was a Herbert Lee Community Center until you read a book after you retired? That’s how far I think I disassociated
                myself from the movement. After law school, well after my second year, I clerked at the Office of Economic Opportunity in
                Washington in the General Council’s office. I think my close friend Vicky Popkin was, I think she was working in New York
                that summer. But she wanted—she had worked for two years before law school, in between college and law school, so she was
                going to be working in Washington after we finished law school. I wanted to—I didn’t want to work in New York. Didn’t
                have any connection with Boston. New York would have been too close to home. Washington was a natural place for me to work.
                That was a good summer. Then third year, looking for a position, I applied for all the civil rights positions, which were
                highly competitive. Very few of them at the Justice Department or whatever. And the Anti-Poverty Program was just beginning,
                and so I applied to be a legal services attorney in California. I took the California bar and they wanted a bar admission.
                They wanted to put you in the courtroom immediately, and I wouldn’t have the bar admission until January so I continued
                looking in Washington. But my first job was with the United Planning Organization, which was the community action agency
                receiving federal funds, anti-poverty money. And we wrote delegate agency contracts, funneling that federal money out to
                community groups and D.C. government, it was a regional—. So even including the neighboring county governments, and within
                two years, I felt the effects of Black Power. The atmosphere in the agency changed. I felt less welcome as a white trying to
                do my work, and I also felt that I could contribute more elsewhere or that I was not doing as much as I might. So I
                resigned. Interesting also that I was at the United Planning Organization the exact two years that Wiley Branton was there.

                He’s a wonderful, wonderful man. I took the D.C. bar and applied for private practice in D.C. and Trovon Bower recognized
                that I knew something about contracts and hired me and I got into the field of government contracts and practiced in that
                field there and with Morgan, Lewis, and Bockius for almost ten years, I guess. And that qualified me to be an administrative
                judge on a Board of Contract Appeals. And after a three hour interview, I was rated and I mean I was initially qualified
                under the statute, the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. I was then qualified, rated highly qualified. Eligible for one of the
                few positions that there are as a Board of Contract Appeals judge and found an opportunity at the National Aeronautics and
                Space Administration.

                We handled disputes that were presented by contractors. Once a contracting officer for a federal agency issues a final
                decision, whether that is terminating a contract for default, or denying a claim for additional funds, defective
                specifications, change orders, changes. The contractor can appeal to either, to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims or to an
                administrative board. We were intended to provide fast, inexpensive, informal relief, but it tended to be quite litigious
                once the attorneys were representing the contractors. We issued—. We conducted full trial type proceedings, discovery,
                sworn witness testimony, transcripts, and briefs, and then wrote detailed decisions of findings of fact and conclusions of
                law that were issued by a panel of three judges and subject to review and appeal only to the U.S. Court of Claims, U.S.
                Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And I was there ten years. We did not have a large caseload that would sustain the
                required, statutorily required board of three full time judges so we initiated the idea of a merger of the NASA board with
                the Department of Defense board. And I became a judge on the armed services Board of Contract Appeals.

                the rule of law in the decision of cases. What I tried to do was offer the contractor a full and fair hearing. And to listen
                and to be fair and then to, of course, write a decision that would be understandable.

                Yes, yes. There were situations where you’re, where the situation cried out that this poor contractor had really been
                victimized by the way the thing went and this was da da da da da. In the end, you needed to say no I’m sorry.

                I enjoyed the job very much and I enjoyed the independence of the job and the way, everything about it. But I learned how to
                do it. Every case was different and it was always interesting in that respect, but there was something of a formula to be
                applied to getting to a result. And I, well I got the idea for the book from a friend knowing—I have very large library of
                books that I acquired as they were published about the Civil Rights Movement and you know— when I mentioned the library,
                she said, she suggested that I write a book and then I, you know, the idea took. So I really started before I retired, I
                tried. I remember I talked to a literary agent and she asked for the first chapter and I was [laughter]—. I wasn’t
                prepared to stay up nights when I was working to write the first chapter. So—

                opened up so much for me because I’ve gone to the conferences of the Veterans of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement in
                Jackson and just met so many, so many new people, you know, it’s a whole new world for me.

                Well, I’m interested in what other people say to me. You know, they kind of can’t believe that I did that or that I took
                such courage. I never felt that way, but now you—. You know, I’m trying to follow what other people are doing and
                writing about and saying and as students we changed history, is one of the things that I recently heard. And we certainly
                did, because we did not influence the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that’s a mistake that some people make, that Freedom
                Summer did not have anything to do with that. It was done before we got there. But the Voting Rights Act, certainly, and the
                reform in the Democratic Party is just absolutely incredible. And the possibility of the election of Obama in 2008 is
                directly traced to the work that we did. And the work was not done by a few leaders. The work was done by many, many, many
                people. Maybe the SNCC activist, the students, who really were in there in very, at a very dangerous time for themselves
                personally and maybe the volunteers going in there—. By the way, there were only 500 of us. There were not 1,000
                college-aged volunteers. There were just a lot of professionals that dipped in for a couple of weeks that make up the
                thousand. We made a difference, and if we made a difference maybe it took a long time, but we made a difference and we made
                a contribution and things are better, then I want young people today to believe that and not to be cynical and pessimistic
                about our current dysfunctional government with a Congress that can’t seem to pass any legislation. But there is a way—.
                One of the things I learned to do, I think, in North Carolina, was to write a letter to state a position and I did that
                during the summer. I have done that since, but I think I have done it more complaining about a product than on a political
                issue. Living in D.C. we don’t have our Congress—. A congressman, congressperson and senators. But someday we may, but I
                think that’s always a deterrent. But I’ve always voted. That was the registrar in North Carolina said, “Make sure you
                always vote.” You know, we’ve got to participate and it’s up to every individual to do that. And once a single person
                finds a passion, finds something that’s important, something that they want to change, then it’s time to find somebody
                else who feels the same way and to reach out and once you have a larger group, maybe that’s what we call community
                organizing. But getting together into a larger mass, it will make a difference and I feel it’s important to encourage that
                among young people. I don’t—. I have not done public speaking. I have not spoken to student groups, but when I do have a
                chance to talk to a student, that’s what I want to say.

                I wondered when you were talking about that, because my experience is that sometimes—that a lot of students do take that
                away from actually studying the Civil Rights Movement. It’s one of the things they can get, if they’re taught it in a
                certain way and that they often find it really empowering, to use that word. But to talk to people who were their age and
                did do things like this and it makes them ask themselves questions, what is my—. So I wondered if you had actually spent
                time speaking to students, if you’ve had that opportunity.

                Particularly, of course, the second group. But sitting in the Freedom House, and hearing the cars, hearing the cars going
                around and not knowing. It was the uncertainty. And then we learned, oh, that was the police. They were making sure that
                nothing was going to happen to us. And you wonder if that’s true, but I think it was. Because that was the nature of
                Greenville. That they wanted to make sure that nothing, that nothing was happened. There was no Klan there, no Citizen’s
                Council was allowed to organize in Greenville.

                That was a standard concern. The only—. The closest thing I came to violence was being at a VFW dance at the beginning of
                the summer. You know, in this huge open hall, and of course I was one of—. I might have been the only white woman there. I
                don’t know whether any, a group of volunteers went to this dance because it was a fundraiser sponsored by Charles Moore,
                who was very active in that VFW, to raise money for the project. I said well if they’re raising money for our project, we
                should go. And I wanted to talk about voter registration with all these black dudes there, right, at the dance. So I was
                dancing. I don’t know whether—. I probably had a cup of beer and danced with one guy. Danced with a second guy. The
                second guy asked me to go out on the porch, which was a great relief because it was so hot and crowded on the dance floor.
                The first guy comes out and pulls a knife.

                the summer of 1964. So I went across the street and sat at a picnic table at some kind of barbeque joint and waited for my
                colleagues to take me back, back to the safe black community.
