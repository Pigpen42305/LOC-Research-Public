                    Okay. I was born in Madison, Illinois in 1923, and later, my daddy moved to Arkansas to take over the farm that--when his
                    daddy died, and he came down to Arkansas to take over the farm for his mother and that's how we got to Arkansas.

                    Illinois. Well, I was there--I mean, we were in Illinois, you know, when I was born. Daddy had moved to Illinois and he was
                    working and that's where we were born, and then he came back after his father died to take over this 88-acre farm for his
                    mother. That's why, that's what brought us back.

                    A little because I was, mostly stayed in the house and kind of fixed them and stuff, but see, at 7 I wasn't going to be
                    helping, but it was okay. What was it like growing up there? It was good. It was different. It was so different from
                    Illinois, just say for instance, my first year in school was in Illinois and I see in Illinois, I was first grade, everybody
                    had had their own room. And they had a place where you--a little room where you hang your coats and things and that was when
                    I got to Arkansas--well, first let me back up. In Illinois I just had to walk about a block to school, no more than that,
                    and when I got to Arkansas, we had to walk four, five miles to school, and then you get in the school and everybody is in
                    the same room from the first through the eighth grade. And they had little nails on the wall at the back of the room where
                    you hang your coats, and you could take your little snack. They would sit at the back of the wall and that was just so
                    different. It was just hard getting used to that. That's what was strange to me when we moved to Arkansas, and the
                    classroom's just one big room, and like, fourth through the--first through fourth grade would be on one end of the building,
                    and fifth through eighth, they were on the other end and the big heater is right--you all know what a heater is?

                    So it was in the middle and that's about it. It didn't take me long to get used to it, walking. It wasn't bad but I just
                    wasn't used to it, but it didn't take me long to catch on, okay.

                    Here in Marvell. At that time, Marvell only went through--Marvell only went to the 10th grade. The high school went to 10th
                    grade here in Marvell, and this is where I got my--up to 10th grade. What you would do, you’d have to find someone to live
                    with and just daddy would pay them rent and see if they had a woodstove, too, and they would--he had - - shop on wood, so he
                    would put that wood in the wagon and leave my brothers bringing - - kept us wood through winter, that's how we kept warm.
                    And that's about... I think that's about it. But--and I graduated--when you graduate, this graduation was from the 10th
                    grade because this is as far as they went, and they had a school in Helena that went to the 12th grade, so that's where my
                    sister went and finished. But at the time, I finished, my mama got sick and I didn't go any farther. And then years later,
                    at school, I got my GED. They were giving people GEDs and then years, a few years later, I was working with Mid-Delta and
                    they said let us go to college and so I just got thirty--I was in, you know, early childhood. Okay.

                    That's good. Describe for me the difference between the schools, between the schools that you were allowed to attend and the

                    Oh, okay. Well, there's a lot of difference. How can I explain that? We were in this one-room school like I say, I already
                    explained that, and then they were--the other schools, the white schools, just beautiful and all together, and the white
                    children rode the bus to school but we walked. And that was the difference. And one thing that brought to mind when you said
                    that, we'd be walking to school and the white--the bus passed us, there's a boy on the other side of the metal and he'd be
                    passing by and he'd say "nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger," so one day, a boy got--he was waiting for him and the boy
                    stepped on the ditch and he got him a stick, so the feller put his hand out of the window and said "nigger, nigger," he
                    popped him, and after that they never--they had the window rolled up when they'd come through.

                    There was a newspaper report not too long ago. It talked about how one of your daughters has said that she wanted to be

                    So when I got upset with her, and like the spirit say, I asked her why--it came to me just like that. And I said, now why do
                    you want to be white? So we can have some swings and some seesaws and have a pretty school, and see, if I had cut her off I
                    never would have known her reason. And she said it's since she'd been grown, that was the pretty school. Oh, yes, and we
                    could have some swings and seesaws and we didn't have any of that, just the naked ground, just nothing. And of course we had
                    invented our own - - games and like that.

                <p class='pad'>
                    I think the first thing that motivated me, if I can kind of tell, explain the Marvell school district, okay, the Marvell
                    school district covers like, oh... 20 miles around. And there were a school--okay, we had so many schools out in the--see, I
                    grew up in Gum Bottom. Somebody grew up in Coffers Creek [phonetic]--there was a school everywhere, where there was a church
                    there was a school. And then the Marvell school district years later decided to build a school down there for--and about six
                    of the communities came together, went to this one school. It was a beautiful school, but what happened after three or four
                    years, the sewage start messing up, and the sewage would back up in the school so at first it was just water and they would
                    come on and say "Oh, the bathroom flooded today," and see, I wasn't paying it much attention. The bathroom flooded, and it
                    would come on--it got where it got so bad, everything was flooding out and the boys had to clean it up. They'd get them - -
                    from the store, the boys had to get the boxes and things and clean it up, so we decided to go to the school board. That's
                    where I got started, went to the school board to tell them about it, and they would say, "Oh, they just don't know how to
                    use the bathroom." And so it went on so long, they'd come home from playing so long, so regular, my husband said "I'm going
                    to go out there and see this thing." And so we had gone to the school board for several times and they just wouldn't do
                    anything, just felt like we didn't know how to use the bathroom at all. And the last time we went to the school board and my
                    husband asked them about fixing it again, - - just my husband and another lady, she's passed away, but coming from the
                    school board that night, my husband said, "If I could get these people to take the children out of school, they'd fix it."
                    That man got up the next morning and went all through the community and was telling them about it, and everybody agreed to
                    take their children out, and so that's the first boycott, turn at boycott, and when we did, so they went down the next day.
                    This was on a Friday--we'd come that Monday, my husband went down to the school to see what was going on. He said well, I
                    forget how many children they had, but eight or ten children showed up at school, and so after that--and it just stayed
                    vacant until they didn't get to school at all that year.

                    school and they send people down--well, what happened, they were going to send somebody down to see about the plumbing. And
                    so come to see the president of the school, his brother was--what do you call it, sanitation thing in Helena, so they send
                    someone down to see how it was when we took the children out of school. And so the superintendent said there wasn't nothing
                    wrong with it and so we wanted to have it checked, so they called a feller, whoever you call that came out and checked it,
                    and he said, "Oh, it's fine. Nothing wrong with the bathroom. It's fine." But see, that was his brother that checked it, and
                    see, Howard was here at that time, and Howard called the sanitation place from Little Rock, and they came down and checked
                    it out, and they made them dig it up, and do it over because it was put up--it was put in going up here, and that's why the
                    bathroom was messing up. And they fixed it and we got back in school. I guess it lasted...

                    Mr. Adam wanted him to bring some people in that may be interested and four or five of us went to this meeting and listened

                    Now... I'm sorry, I thought I stepped on one of your sentences. I'm sorry. Now, there were SNCC workers who were working in
                    the area.

                    Myrtle Glascoe and Howard Himmelbaum. And so once we got visited, you know, they were here a while before anything, we
                    started to do anything, but just kind of got to feel and we would meet and they'd always have a building full, a church full
                    to come out and hear what we were doing and what we were trying to do and after so long, he said now, you all do it yourself
                    now, but they would just be there. He didn't want to be the leader all the time, and that's about that.

                    Some of them, the first place they lived was my uncle, Howard Himmelbaum, he lived with my uncle and they had a place in
                    Helena that they stayed but my uncle kept them for a while until he got nervous because he had a store and his house was
                    right by the store and they didn't want white folks to see him coming out of his house so then he moved, he moved way back
                    and lived with my cousin Carrie--Carrie Davis [phonetic] at that time. But he had to walk a couple miles back to the mud and
                    stuff to get over there, and so we said, well, won't nobody find him back there because if he just comes out on the porch
                    and opened the door, the store was right there, even with the house and stuff. We didn't want him. Then my uncle got real
                    nervous about having this white man living with him. He didn't stay with him long--maybe a month, and he moved back down
                    where he couldn't be found and walk out every day, come by the house and we eat and all. I’m thinking they also had a
                    place in Helena where they could live. Come on, ask.[background noise]

                    the people--about six of them were, you know, standing back, giving us, you know, spinning their ideas and things. And

                    happened down in my country, Maxine Hathaway was one of the schoolteachers here in Marvell, and you know, on Sundays if we
                    were in church, after Sunday school we're going to say something about the situation. And so different people told her,
                    "Girl, you better stop going to the church. Tell me they have civil rights meetings down at that church." And so she left
                    our church and went to the church where they didn't meet, came here to Marvell and went to church.

                    doing. How did they respond to you?

                    Well, not really, but I'll tell you one day I was in the drugstore, and the lady that worked at the drugstore--by the way,
                    she's in a nursing home now. But anyway, this white man was in there, and I was getting my medicine and she said to me, she
                    said, "There she is, there she is, there she is," like they were trying to find out who was that that was doing the civil
                    rights work and so that's the only thing that I saw.

                    Overtis Adams had a cross--not Overtis. This is way out in the country. I can't think of his name right now, but they burned
                    a cross in his yard and then John Hamilton, he's one of the leaders. He's one of the big leaders that was with us--John

                    Just two. One in Masco Anderson [phonetic]. Now, John Hamilton, it got in the air because he was the main person along with
                    my husband, John Hamilton--it got in the air that--and he lived way back off the road--that a gang had planned to come and
                    you know, attack them that night. And so what the men did was about 10 or 12 men, they met down there with their guns,
                    because this man is way back, had to go down the field to get to his house and they went there and stayed all night to see
                    if anybody was coming in, because one of the boys said now if they come driving out through here I'm going to blow them
                    away, so that's the incident there.

                    showing in Little Rock, you know, going in the school and the club and things. My little girl said, "Oh, the news is good

                    It wasn't really an issue about the county fair, but this is the way it happened: We decided to boycott the school and so
                    Reverend Anderson, the man with the burned cross in the yard, he's at the meeting. He said I'll tell you all what, since
                    we're boycotting school, let's boycott that fair, and they said yeah, and that's how we come to boycott the fair. And
                    another thing about the fair, the superintendent, you know, - - in college in Pine Bluff, that's a black college at that
                    time. The superintendent, the choir from - - College was coming down to sing at the choir, and we heard that--we were in
                    Little Rock at this trial about this boy. You know, we had to go to trial, we had to go to court, so we were in Little Rock,
                    so Mrs. Hamilton on our way back home, she said let's go by the college and tell them don't come down to sing because we're
                    boycotting everything. So we went back and talked with them, and the superintendent was out of town. They said he would have
                    to change it; we can't change it. But anyway, they came on down to sing and then I got another lady that we just, we said
                    let's go to the fair and see how it's going to come out so we went to the fair and just parked out from--in the ditch about
                    the fair, and it worked. People didn't come. I saw some little children come, saw some little white boys--they'd come
                    around. They had heard something. They didn't know what--some little black boys, too. Oh, they say you ain’t supposed to
                    go to fair today, they'd be--and they'd just run, just running, and it was just... It was just nothing going on because
                    nobody came. But the college choir came down, this big bus came down and children got off and they washed up the bleachers,
                    they sing like they had a crowd but it wasn't sold there. And see, the fair didn't make any money that year. So that's what
                    happened with that. And it was just interesting, too. You know, some things just motivate you--once you get started, you
                    want to reach at something else.

                    Well, like I say, the children going have to go to school and they saw it. It was like, what they did, they burned the shape
                    of a cross in the grass and we all just went out and looked at it, and the grown people knew what it was like, what it was
                    about, but my daughter was telling me lately, she said see, out here you all are whispering, you all--you know, we didn't
                    sit down and really explain to them. We hear you all talking but all I know, they said when they burn a cross in your yard,
                    it was because white folks--something about white folks didn't like you if you got a cross burned in your yard so that's
                    what she was telling me.

                    I guess I was--what's that that people take to make them strong and bolder, these athletes--I guess I was on a high, and I
                    was just fine with it, because--just had a little fight in me and just ready to go on. But it didn't stop us. And then
                    before that then, I don't know which comes first--it doesn't matter. When they set the shop on fire where we keep the
                    tractors and trucks and things, my daughter went out on the porch one night to do something, and she looked up and she said,
                    "The shop's on fire" and boy, everybody jumped to attention then. My husband had gone to bed. I said, the man must have been
                    expecting somebody to attack him. He jumped out of the bed so quick that he didn’t even put on his shoes. So he went out
                    there and the truck--the tractor was out there, so what he did, he found the log chain, what old chain he had, hooked to a
                    tractor, then hooked it to the truck, pulled the truck out across the field, and that's where the truck burned up, and what
                    had happened, somebody had stuck a rag or something down in the gas tank and set it, set the rag on fire, and that's what
                    was burning, so--but anyway, it caught the truck. Now, if we hadn't seen it, it probably would have got the tractors and
                    everything else. Pulled it out across the field and that's where it burned up. And like, we didn't put no papers in there,
                    so we weren't doing stuff like that.

                    Yeah, in the cotton picker. They didn't lock up--he was working some land way away from home and when they get through, they
                    just leave it in the field until they get back, so his brother went to the field that morning to, you know, pick cotton. He
                    said before I got there I could see some tracks, looked like four tractor tracks, so he said, somebody's been up here
                    sniffing my--getting gas out of his tank so that's what he put it to. And he got up there and got on the cotton picker, he
                    says I got halfway down, piece down through the field, it stopped. And they said you can put sugar in the tank and that will
                    lock up everything but they don't know what made it happen, but it locked up and they didn't have no cotton picker. But
                    James, the brother was a good mechanic, you know, - - mechanic on himself, and they fixed it.

                    Okay. I guess this is what my grandson is saying. I was going home from work one day and this truck pulled up and it was
                    coming but when it got close to me it slowed down. When it slowed down, some kind of flash went over me, that's the first
                    time something--I felt uncomfortable. They followed me just a little while and after a while, the driver must have changed
                    his mind--the driver pulled off and sped by me but when he sped by, the man on the passenger side had his little pistol. He
                    shot right across in front of the hood of my car. And I wouldn't tell my husband because I knew he was going to get out and
                    try to find who did it and I didn't want him putting himself in danger like that. It was a long time before I told him;
                    didn't tell any of them, because I go to work every day. He would have been thinking about me going to work every day.

                    I don't remember him talking about being afraid or nothing. But I know one--I can say this: To get to one of our farms we
                    had to drive through the white man's property, and so the man told him, three of them told him don't come back through there
                    and for a long time they went like, six or seven miles out of the way to get to the field when they could get to it like, 30
                    minutes directly. And so one day he came in, he had done that for a long time, I guess maybe a couple years before. But
                    anyway, when he left one day he said, well, I'm gone. And he had his pistol--the first time I ever saw him get his pistol.
                    He said they might get me today, but I think I can get some of them. At least I think I can get some of them, and I think
                    that's when he broke the thing about going through this man's field, didn't nobody ever bother him, though.

                    Well, like I say, I wasn't thinking about it. I was sitting at my desk, see, Mid-Delta was - - and I was sitting at my desk
                    and it just dropped in by spirit and all it said was something for children and it stayed there like, like a couple months,
                    just something for children, just something within, until one morning Mr. Gale Thrower, the Ag teacher, came to my office
                    and he says, Miss Jackson, I see you all have a room back there that you're not using. And he said you know how the children
                    haven't got anywhere to go, and I would like to fix it up, you know, where the children have something to--and I said, boy,
                    God must have sent you here and we got started from there. His thing was - - my thing was education, because I wanted more
                    head starts--I wanted every child in the district to have seen a book before they go to school. And what I did that year,
                    retired teachers, I had about two--Maxine Hathaway, Anna May Smith, and by me--I used to haul, pick up children, take them
                    to head start. Then I knew where everybody was, and I went to different houses like Mrs. Hathaway, took about three houses
                    to just go and read a book. I said you all are all I want, I want to let every child see a book before you go to school you
                    see. You know, we just did--that wasn't our culture, so when I found the families for, and they went to these families that
                    read stories--did the same thing we do at head start. And Maxine Hathaway and Anna May Smith and Beatrice, I think Beatrice,
                    the executive director did one. But anyway, that's what I wanted--I said you all are going to see every child that's going
                    to school to have seen a book before they go, and that's what we did. They would take the little their little paint and
                    everything just like we did at head start, put the easel, the tree where it would be an easel and they would do their little
                    painting and stuff and just read little stories to them because you would be surprised that the people never saw a book when
                    they go to school. So that's what I wanted, and I wanted them to have these shots because there were so many children that
                    didn't go to school because you don't have those shots, you can't go to school. And it's so hard for them to get, like, 30
                    miles, you know, out there all the time and so what we did, I got--after these teachers, these ladies did the home start and
                    of course I was doing one too. And what we did about the shots, just come down, the nurses from Helena would come down to
                    this big raggedy center where it was - - and they gave shots. They would come down and give them shots, and then after we
                    got, after we founded BGACDC, then they got a grant and they built a building onto it, and the staff would come from Helena,
                    and that's how they got everything. They did everything there. They do everything there that they did in Helena.

                    The first job I had with Mid-Delta was transporting children to head start, go all--I guess I would do like, maybe 40 miles
                    in the morning, 40 in the evening, going picking up children, going across the fields in different communities, just
                    knocking on the doors and see who was there for head start.

                    15--20, 15 in one room, 15 in another so that's 30 children. And we always had to make a couple of trips. And that was--it
                    was kind of not so nice, but I had the station. The gentleman had been out to my house to ask me if I'd do it. They thought
                    I was the only person that they could find in the district that had a station wagon, and they came down and asked me would I
                    pick up the children for head start. My husband said you can't do that. She's rolling all over this country--so we turned it

                    Well, I tell you, I just thought about this little boy. He's a twin and in head start he was so disrupted. You know when you
                    get upset, he would get up and go around and seat--we sit in a circle, like semicircle. He'd get up and go around and tap
                    everybody on the head, hit them and what I want to get to--he'd get upset and he'd go around and knock the work off the
                    wall. But it came to, we found out that he wasn't coming from a comfortable home. We think that was part of it and so, like
                    when I would take him for field trips, take him for a walk and stuff like that to cool him off, and so that's about--I'd get
                    his name. He's someone that really stood out, and we had to visit, do home visits and we found out--and talked to the
                    parents, so... We had him two years because if you come at 4, you could be there two years. And that's about it.

                    See, I thought I better bring somebody. Okay, I used to--like you said, picking up children and one family lived on this
                    white man's place and I had to go down like a little road to get to it, a little turn road, and I'd go there and pick up, so
                    one day I went to pick her up and she'd have met me out on the highway with her little boy. I said, what are you doing out
                    here? Our boss told us--the man's place they stay on--our boss told us to tell that lady that's driving that white station
                    wagon to stay off his place because I don't want nobody on my place that has something to do with that Martin Luther King.
                    And so she said but don't worry, we're going to get off his place, and what impressed me was maybe in a little better than a
                    year, it was better than a year, they had bought up and built their own house and it's good they got me off of that because
                    after that, I was--moved to head start teacher, home start. That's where you go into the home and teach them. You do the
                    same thing in the home that you did in school, and so I said now it's good they got off his place because when I got to be
                    home start teacher, I had to take all my stuff with me and then once a month we'd have a parent meeting and all the houses
                    would meet together in one house. I said it would have been some black folks moving out, going through the turn road to his
                    field--I said, well, they moved off just in time, so it was just great. Now, that's all I had--I really had forgotten about
                    that one. And the other words, you know--

                    Now, where was I? Now, I say it was good I moved off the place because from head start, picking up the children I had to do
                    home start and that's where you go into the home and carry all your materials and do all the same things you do at school. I
                    said now, if he hadn't put me off this place because like I think I had ten houses that I'd go to but once a month I was
                    required to bring them all together and have a parent meeting, somebody from the main office would come down and do things
                    and I said now, that would have been awful, had they still been on his place because he sure wouldn't want all of us coming
                    back there to a meeting. Even sometimes like at 12 o'clock, the men would come out to feed them. They'd just enjoy, to come
                    out the field and where the head start was and see what we were doing, so we enjoyed--so TJ, I’m glad you made me think of
                    it.

                    School integration, when they wouldn't--when the school system was ordered to integrate and the integration was to be done,
                    like, three years, the first year they were going to do it through the third grade. Then the next year they were going to

                    school this morning, and they were all prepared for you this morning, prepared. And so my cousin, she was braver than I,
                    crazier than I was, however you want to call it. But we said let's go and we drove around there and it was just like she
                    said--from Irving garage [phonetic] all the way around to the bus shop, trucks were bumper to bumper with two, three men on
                    each one of them, waiting for us when we come through the mud, and I don't know what they plan to do, but that's the way it
                    was. And I would like say, when we were boycotting, we had the church--we met at my church. They set up a little library and
                    bought books and things so we could do something while they were out of the school--the children would go down to the church
                    and read books and things like that. That’s all. Like Myrtle said now, the children got to have something while they're
                    out of school, so we were out of school quite a few months there, so at least we can meet and read books and whatever we
                    know verbally. And I guess...

                    Owen Harris [phonetic]. Mm-hmm, because he'll be in some of those papers, but Owen Harris was the judge and once he decided,
                    come made his decision, he ordered them to integrate and one thing he said, there will no longer be two buses riding down

                    Those things - - he would do things like, "Well, you know, the nigger" so the judge, then Walker would have him say it right
                    instead of having him say nigger. That was just kind of funny to me. Every time they'd go out of place he'd correct them.
                    But I really enjoyed the judge, because he ordered them--there would be no problem in Marvell. He said I'd go to any price
                    to see that there would be no problem in Marvell.

                    It's just us and there wasn't any audience. But they like to jump out their seat--they jumped and looked at each other, and
                    so when we went on back to school, the buses, they had to stop at them, because you see, maybe a white person living here
                    and then a black person there would see that one bus would come through to pick up the whites and then there's a black bus
                    and a white bus. And we used to watch for the school buses--let me know when the bus coming. They'd just say "the bus
                    coming" and they'd say "white or black?" And one day my son said--[background noise]

                <p class='pad'>
                    Well, we have three--four component areas in which we have activities here at BGACDC. Of course, those four component areas
                    are we have youth and family services, we have an economic development area, and of course we have housing, and of course
                    there's an administrative area, but in housing we have what we call the BGACDC Manor which is a family dwelling. It's for
                    low-income housing project, and at that location there are some one, two and three-bedroom units and it is our housing
                    project for the city of Marvell. We also have some standalone housing, some units that are operated by the BGACDC and they
                    are rental property housing at BGACDC, so one of our goals here is to provide decent and affordable housing for low-income
                    families and so we do that through that dwelling of family housings that we have here. Then of course in our economic
                    development part, we have here at BGACDC, we have what we call the best food in town--it's called the BFT, best food in
                    town. It provides some employment for persons working in the cafeteria type setting and of course we do serve the best food
                    in town. Economic development also we provide in the summertime some jobs for youth in the summertime and for some
                    middle-aged persons. We actually call it an intergenerational type of program in the summertime--we have college students
                    and we have some youth that are still in high school who are 16 and maybe older, they work a summer program here at BGACDC,
                    so those are some of our economic development type programs. Here in the youth and family service type program, we offer
                    afterschool tutorial programs--we call it our Delta Reach and Teach Program. Our Delta Reach and Teach Program is an
                    afterschool program. It is also a - - program that we have and what we do there, we have some peer tutors and we have of
                    course an - - that is a supervisor but we use high school students as peer tutors and we work with youth from ages of about
                    6 years old up to about 14, and so we have them come over after school in the evening time. Our program this year--in the
                    past we've been operating at five days a week but we took a unique approach this year, we're only operating three days a
                    week because we are partnering with the Marvell school, the Marvell-Elaine school district and they are operating after
                    school tutorial type programs Mondays and Tuesdays, and we operate Wednesdays and Thursdays, and so we took that approach
                    that we might do a holistic approach to the students, and we call them scholars or the students to help them--we offer the
                    same opportunities that they would have found in school. We have the same type of programs that we do in the afternoon that
                    they would also go through at the school site. So that's part of what we do in the youth and family services, and youth and
                    family services also, we offer in the summertime, we're partnered with a couple of partners--USDA and FDA, we're partnered
                    to do what we call the Delta Obesity Research Project, and the Delta Obesity Research Project, it is a project with some
                    scholars or students and with their parents who--it's a volunteer-type project, and we have them assigned up and we are
                    finding out some things about those of us who live here in the delta. We have also found in our Delta Research Project,
                    we've found out that we're deficient in vitamin D. Even though we have plenty of sunlight, but it appears that either we are
                    not getting out in sunlight or we're staying in the house more, or we're not drinking that fortified milk with vitamin D in
                    it, and so through our research project we have found out that in our area here, that vitamin D is one of our deficiencies
                    so we'll work in our Delta Research Project trying to improve that by offering a program in the summertime where we offer
                    kids some holistic meals, some nutrition-full meals, snacks, and of course some milk and things that have more vitamin D in
                    it. That's one of our research projects. Go ahead.

                    There is. There is one person who is still with us who we call our ambassador, and that is Mrs. Gertrude Jackson. She is up
                    in age, and I'm not going to tell you how old she is--I hope you don't film that, because I think I've really forgotten what
                    actually her age is, but I know for sure she is in her 80s, for sure, and she has been here with us since the '70s, actually
                    since about '78, '77 timeframe. She's been here the whole time working with us trying to make this community development
                    center here, BGACDC, a viable part of the community and a necessity in the community. She has worked to do that. She is a
                    person who goes out and presents BGACDC wherever her travels take her. She's one who's talking about BGACDC. She and a
                    couple of other community persons, one of them being Mr. Gale Thrower, he's no longer with us, he's passed on--the two of
                    them take it on themselves along with some other community persons to establish this place here because they were looking
                    for an opportunity in providing things for boys and girls in our community, and then of course they also said that they
                    wanted adults involved so that's how we came up with the name Boys Girls Adults Community Development Center, because they
                    looked at not only do we want your boys and girls but we also want you as a parent to be involved also, and so they came up
                    with that slogan, that name to name this place. At that time, they were just looking for an opportunity for persons in the
                    community to have some place to go and something to do but as it developed and things began to progress, they began to take
                    on more ideas, an idea of course having available affordable housing, an idea of also providing economic development for
                    people in the community, so they began to develop and take on those ideas.

                    Over the last 20 plus years, over the last 20 plus years this center has had a great impact in the lives of maybe some
                    hundreds of young people and many of those young persons have went on from this place, some of them to become entrepreneurs
                    themselves, some of them to become lawyers and doctors and to do well and they will tell you that it is because they were
                    involved in some type of either boys program or girls program here at the center. We have a program called Girls Are Girls.
                    We have a problem called Dad, which is dealing with boys, dealing with adolescent development, and those programs are
                    programs that have been mentor programs that have helped some of those persons throughout their lives. And we had just here
                    recently in our banquet that we had just the other day, it was on November the 10th--we had one of our young persons who had
                    grown up here at the BGACDC, to come back--Marcus Thrower. He is of course the son of Mr. Gale Thrower, but he is in Atlanta
                    now and he is an investment consultant, so that's the type of quality of persons who have come through this place. We have
                    several lawyers and maybe even a doctor that has come through this place. Our executive director, one of her daughters is a
                    lawyer who has come through BGACDC right here, so those are some of the positive things that this center has done, and even
                    though those who may not have achieved that level of being a lawyer or a doctor or an investment banker and things of that
                    nature, we have several educators who have traveled these halls here that we have here.

                    then, I said now, well, maybe I shouldn't have been up speaking so loud, she wouldn't have tried to put this here, this, the
                    weight of doing this business on me, but I appreciate her having confidence in me and knowing that perhaps she could trust
                    what she and other seniors had started some years ago, that she would look to say that she would want to trust that to a

                    told him, I said, I guess - - you stood out that night and I just couldn't forget him. That's the man and I said I know he's
                    good for us because God just put him in my eyesight because I don't know if I would have taken that much time just seeing
                    people, a first impression when he was young and then I could just see something in him, and didn't see him no more until
                    about 15 years later, he just got grown then. Okay, and that's all I wanted to say about Reverend Turner. And he just--and
                    we're trying to get him to become, our director has gotten tired, she's just holding on, trying to get him to accept but
                    he's doing fine. He's not sure he wants to take it all over and I wish I'd thought about it--I showed you our housing
                    project. We came right back. Okay, so that's about it.

                    Well, when we got started, Mrs. Beatrice wanted housing. There were lots of little raggedy houses around her and Bea, that
                    was the first thing she wanted, housing, and so we just went to work. They went to work on housing and went to FHA and
                    that’s who built them, FHA, and when we got it all set up, it took a long time, and once we got it, then you have to have
                    open house, you know, let the community know what you're doing, and so that day there was packed out around here, and I come
                    in that morning and all these white folks are there. They came in to stop it. They said they didn't want no housing project
                    here because it brings drugs in the community, and so the mayor was a sweet little white lady--in other words, I won't go
                    there, though. But anyway, we had to overcome that. They were trying to stop it because a housing project wasn't good for a
                    community, they say, but we wanted it. The first place we planned to put it, they weren't selling and so when the white
                    folks decided to let us have it, it was way down on country road, back some woods, and FHA said no, we don't want to have
                    a--they wanted it back and we wanted it on the highway where people can see it and that's how we got it, and that's about
                    the gist of it, that we had to really fight to get to build it.

                    Theodore Eldridge Chilling [phonetic] here and I'm a grandson of Miss Gertrude Jackson. Her oldest daughter, Juanita, is my
                    mother. I work for a USDA farm service agency now, and I actually work with all the farm commodity programs, disaster
                    programs throughout Phillips County which is, since Miss Gertrude is a landowner, farmer out--I kind of oversee her land for
                    the government as well. But it's kind of--I don't know what word I'm actually wanting right now, but my grandfather used to
                    farm here and his brother, I guess at the age of 11, I was helping farm, per se. It was more of a hobby for me, fun, because
                    I got to drive tractors at a very young age and we spent a lot of time with my grandmother and grandfather spending the
                    night, be at work, be ready to go like 5:30 in the morning, so I've been around farming a long time.

                    Yeah, I guess the main thing I can remember now--they were all great storytellers that kind of the reason I've heard a lot
                    of the stories that Miss Gertrude has shared, I've heard variations or something about it, a lot of new stories also, but
                    they were great storytellers and it never came off negative or someone did this or to me or we're victims. It was more like,
                    this is just what happened. We woke up one day, this had happened and this is what we did to get over that, but it wasn't
                    anything ugly or nasty about the stories that I heard as far as retaliation. That had just come with the times, so I kind of
                    got their perspective as far as just another day.

                    Well, you know, not being a victim--you just go out and whatever you want, you make your own way. You ask anybody you think
                    you need to for help, but you know, you're not really--or I don't per se wait or require any help, but I don't look at it as
                    I can go talk to one person; I can't go talk to this group or that person. It's just, you get up, this is what you want to

                    Well, it's funny but I guess the awareness, per se, and the opportunity from the way she describes it nonchalantly, I had a
                    thought to help kids but in that it's been hundreds and hundreds of kids and families that she's affected just from having
                    the idea and then maybe someone taking her idea and building a wall, making it concrete, something that people can come to
                    and anyone from the Marvell area that wants, you know, they might ask who am I and who's my family, so I can say well, my
                    other--on my father's side, I'm an Eldridge, they may or may not know, but if I say I'm a Jackson, Gertrude Jackson--oh,
                    yeah, we know her. That's from the police, the mayor, state representatives all the way down, they know her and the family,
                    and so just an awareness of :what she's done or been behind as far as community, everybody's aware of that.[background

                    thought, what I was going to say before that. But anyway, it's just a meeting place we have that wouldn't--we just wouldn't
                    have places to meet. Didn't it seem like you started to ask me something?

                    It's not as tight as it needs to be, but this center is an example of when the community was tight and from Miss Gertrude
                    having been one of the founders or one of the primary responsible parties for getting this center up, since everything that
                    the minorities did had to come through here, there's the only place--they associate this place with her. But the community
                    was tight as far as this is one example of when they came together and did something for themselves by themselves and it's
                    still standing. I think because it's not--we're not tight now, we don't have any other place to go, this is still here and
                    so it just shows us that we have a lot more work to do.

                    Good question. My colleague here is wondering is this community center played a role in starting community centers in other
                    communities across and nearby.

                    No, the West Helena area has a Boys &amp; Girls Club, but it's maybe less than five years old, so this was the only center
                    of its kind, per se--maybe a 25, even 50 mile radius. So I don't know how many of those cities actually came here, but the
                    smaller communities, which used to be quite a nice population, they would all come here and especially like she say, when
                    funerals, you've got reunions and everybody come back home, they come to the center.

                    It was just kind of like--I can't find the word, but it's just like, just out there, just in action--I enjoyed it. What's
                    the word for that? It wasn't fear. I guess that's the most thing I could say--I would never fear for a friend.

                    I can personally say that I have never heard a negative story or anything about fear, it was almost like an afterthought
                    because when you read your history books and because this story wasn't publicized in the area--I went to the Helena school
                    district 20 miles away, we read in the history books. I'm like, my family went through that but it was an afterthought. I
                    didn't know how serious it was because it wasn't talked to in the way that we have to be careful or this is what happened or
                    you know, don't tell people who you are because of so-and-so. We started the center and we helped people and you know, you
                    don't get the gist of it, but this is going on when Martin Luther King and other people are dying for the very same things
                    that they're going through but it just doesn't hit home as being nothing to fear or even worry about, per se. Just get up
                    and go to the center.

                <p class='pad'>
                    Yeah. Well, yes, I do think that there are other centers that have been influenced from BGACDC. You have in Marianna,
                    Arkansas, it's a center there and it's called the Lee County Community Development Center, I think it is, in Marianna. They
                    were influenced and what I mean by influenced is because Mrs. Beatrice Shelby, executive director and Mrs. Gertrude Jackson
                    have been influenced, have been some influential women in our community that other women in other communities have seen the
                    things that they produced here in Marvell, and have begun to work in their communities to the same, and I would say that
                    Marianna area which is in Lee County here in Arkansas, and then there are several areas over in Mississippi. We were part of
                    an Arkansas, Mississippi and a Louisiana collaborative one time, part of the Foundation of Midsouth, and so there were
                    several other communities that were influenced by the things that had transpired right here in Marvell, Arkansas. Here in
                    our recent, just a couple of years ago, our school system partnered--well, our school system had to take on another
                    community. It used to just be the Marvell community and now it's the Marvell-Elaine community and so there are persons in
                    Elaine now thinking about how they can have a community development center or some type of community center there in the
                    Marvell area, so I would say that there are plenty of places that we have traveled around Arkansas and Louisiana and
                    Mississippi and even maybe even in some other areas who have taken their thoughts from what we do right here at BGACDC. And
                    it's all because, like I say, we have a great ambassador in Mrs. Jackson and of course our executive director--when they go
                    places they're always talking about BGACDC.
