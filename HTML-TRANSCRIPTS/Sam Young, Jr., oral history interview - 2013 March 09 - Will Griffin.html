                exactly about the same place. And, you know, little kids, you know, when somebody’s messing with you, you know—we threw
                rocks at the bus! I mean, that’s what we did. [Laughter]And the bus driver would put the lights on, you know, the brake
                lights. We’d see the brake lights come on.

                qualified, you know, to read. And I’m glad he cared about that. And I had the kind of teachers that you didn’t escape.

                “Well, stand up!” And when I stood up, you know, the spelling book was right there.And she spanked me. And then, I

                I got involved in it, the Southwest Georgia Project—New Communities, Incorporated, which was the land deal, was a project
                of the Southwest Georgia Project, you know, and that’s how I got involved in it. Sherrod went to New York and found out
                that the land was for sale here in Southwest Georgia.

                And there were several other people, you know, also moved out. Some of them were Southwest Georgia Project members, and some

                into some things, you know, because I look at the situation with our black youth, you know. There were things that we could
                be doing to make a difference, you know, here in Southwest Georgia, and probably over the nation, you know, because we have
                students coming from New York, Chicago, you know.

                to your group, you know, and try to implement some of the things, you know, problem solving and things that are facing you,
                you know, apply that what you learned from those, from their teachings.
