                Um, if I could, let me take you back to begin our conversation with some reflection, perhaps, on your father and your aunts

                Well, my father was a schoolteacher primarily, and, uh, my aunts shared the responsibility of rearing me, since my mother
                had died when I was ten days old. So, uh, it was a conglomeration between my father and my aunts, primarily.

                Well, he was an educator, a graduate of Virginia State, uh, University - no, Virginia State College. And, uh, [sighs] he was
                teaching in Smithfield, Virginia, and, uh, I was born in Smithfield. And, uh, he was a strict constructionist, I’d say if
                he were a lawyer, but, uh, he ruled the roost in a fair and impartial manner, long as I understood that he was the boss and
                I was to do what I was told to do when I was told to do it.Uh, but other than that, uh, we traveled from one end of Virginia
                to another. I don’t know how many elementary schools I went to, because, uh, all we had - all he had to do was get an
                offer of a better job, uh, and, uh, we’d have our bags packed within twenty-four hours and be on our way to the next
                town.

                He had been teaching school in Virginia all of his life. And, uh, when World War II began, he decided that he would go to
                Washington and work in the Pentagon. After a year or two there, he decided that, uh, he wanted to go back to teaching and he
                went to Baltimore where he taught at, uh, Morgan State University. And, uh, while at Morehead State University, according to
                the stories they told me, he got a call from Claflin College in Orangeburg [South Carolina], and they offered him a job in
                Orangeburg as Dean of Claflin.And, lo and behold, the next thing I knew, I was on a train headed to South Carolina, a place
                I had never been to, had no idea - the only thing I knew about it was the stories I had heard, and the stories were told by
                my young friends who advised me that I was going to a place where they were probably going to end up lynching me. But, uh -
                and I thought they were telling the truth!When we got into Florence [South Carolina], uh, the Pee Dee River, as I recall it,
                was on one of its, uh, high levels. And, uh, I said, “Oh, my God!” The conductor said, uh, “Florence is the next stop,
                and you change in Florence for Orangeburg.” I knew that this Orangeburg place was a place filled with water and alligators
                and various and sundry other things. But, lo and behold, when I stepped off the train in Orangeburg, they were human beings,
                they were nice people, and once I got to know them, they treated us as family. And, uh, all the stories that, uh, my young
                friends had lied to me about were exaggerated.

                Yeah, okay. Um, other impressions - you’ve just said that, um, that the welcome you received by the community in
                Orangeburg and around Claflin was a warm one. Can you talk a little bit more about your impressions of the town, of the
                college?

                Well, this was my first day, and I was scared out of my wit’s end. I was in a strange town, didn’t know anybody, nobody
                knew me, and I didn’t know what it was going to be like. But, uh, it proved to be a welcome that I was pleased with. And,
                uh, within a year or so after I had arrived in Orangeburg, I had a job. I went to work at the College Soda Shop as a soda
                jerk. And, uh, that was an interesting experience, because the College Soda Shop was located, uh, right on the perimeters of
                two colleges. And that was where the young people hung out and drank sodas and ate hamburgers and enjoyed life. And the
                people were warm and friendly. The family that owned the soda shop was the Weber family. And the Webers were instrumental in
                the business community, and they were - they treated me as if I was a member of the family. And I think I worked there for
                about six or eight years, something along in there.

                Well, I was very young, so I don’t have any independent recollection of the - how vibrant the business community was, but
                it was an active community. It was a community that was actively involved in the events of the total community. One of the
                things I do recall during my stay at Claflin, either the first or second year, somewhere along in there, the Ku Klux Klan
                paraded down, uh, the street right in front of Claflin and South Carolina State. It was an interesting, uh, spectacle.

                Well, at that time, I was not - I had not formalized what my ambitions were going to be. I think I probably formally set my
                goals after we left Claflin and, uh, went to, uh, Morgan State, and I got an opportunity to observe the positions of black
                lawyers and what - how they were treated in the black community in Washington, and, uh, it was interesting.

                got individual attention. And they, uh, did not play. They worked you hard, because, uh, I gather from my recollection of
                that period of time, the students and the faculty were out and about, trying to make sure that South Carolina State’s law
                school was able to produce the caliber of lawyers which would justify its existence and, uh, make it a part of the history
                of South Carolina. And I think they succeeded very well.

                Wrighten [III], and, uh, as a result of his activities, and I think he instituted a lawsuit, which resulted in the

            <p>
                Well, it was strange, because, by and large, there had been very few lawyers in South Carolina, black lawyers in South
                Carolina at the time I became a lawyer, and it was a new experience for the black community. As you would talk with them,
                they didn’t understand that if you were a black lawyer you could, uh, go in the courthouse and pull books down and do the
                things that a lawyer would normally do in order to perform his services for his clientele. So, sometimes, you’d take them
                to the courthouse just to show them you could walk in the front door of the courthouse. And, uh, you would, uh, continually
                try to encourage them to get their students, their friends, uh, to, uh, submit their cases to you.And I think one of the
                things that was most disappointing to me as an individual was the fact that there was, with the establishment of the law
                school at South Carolina State, the establishment of a law school at North Carolina Central [University, then North Carolina
                College for Negroes, in Durham, North Carolina]. And, uh, these two schools in our view were similar. But eventually South
                Carolina decided that, in the exercise of its judgment, that it would close the law school at South Carolina State. And, uh,
                we have often wondered why, because as my information now tells me that North Carolina Central has somewhere around three
                hundred students. It’s a fully integrated and a full part of the legal education program of North Carolina, whereas South
                Carolina State’s law school has become a closed entity.

                I had acquired sufficient, uh, influence or connections, or whatever you want to call it, that I was at the head table at a

                possible with my limited capacity to be actively involved, uh, I did keep abreast and kept me informed. In fact, it was as a

                through, uh, Sumter and advised me that they were on their way to somewhere about - the opening of a state park. And, uh,
                that stimulated certain juices to flow, and, uh, as a result, I made a decision that I was going to take my wife and two
                children - no, one child - and leave, uh, Sumter and become a fulltime practicing lawyer.Now, when I say “fulltime,” I
                was reluctant to give up a fulltime gig. Uh, I, uh - when I went to Sumter, one of the first people that communicated with
                me was the president of Morris College, Dr. O.R. Reuben. And, uh, I told him I was going to move and [coughs], excuse me,
                was there anything that he thought that I could do? And, lo and behold, he offered me a job teaching [clears throat] at
                Morris College in South Carolina history, which was right down my - one class a week, two or three days a week. And so, that
                aided in my transition, uh, from, uh -

                in whatever, uh, Chief Counsel Perry was involved in in the desegregation of the state park that they were working on. And
                Reverend Newman was actively involved in everything that was going on in the civil rights community at that time.

            <p>
                Well, the “Friendship Nine” was a bit later on in the history. Um, the “Friendship Nine” - I got a call from Rock
                Hill [South Carolina], and somebody said that, uh, there are some students connected with Friendship College [Friendship
                Junior College in Rock Hill] that are about to do something that could cause them to be arrested, and would I represent
                them? And, of course, I said, “Yes, I’d be pleased to represent them.”And, uh, they were connected with the Congress
                of Racial Equality [CORE], as I remember it. And the Congress of Racial Equality’s field secretary was a gentleman by the
                name of James T. McCain [CORE’s South Carolina field secretary], who, uh, was very active and - guess what - he was a
                citizen of Sumter. So, I knew him, and after receiving a call from Rock Hill community, I decided I’d go.And the first
                time I got, uh, called to Rock Hill - I never will forget it - my old raggedy car broke down. And there was a story [laughs]
                written up in the paper , which says that the Friendship Nine’s lawyer was unable to get to court and it had to be
                postponed. Well, that was not as newsworthy - I didn’t know what they were doing. But I got to Rock Hill eventually and I
                got to meet these ten or twelve students. And it was a simple demonstration. As far as I knew, these nine people were going
                to be tried and get convicted, and I would have gotten their bond, and they would have been out.Well, somewhere somebody had
                not fully informed their lawyer as to what they were going up about. And, lo and behold, after we had tried it, and, uh, the
                judge had imposed his sentence, they then announced to me that, uh, they had a new facet of the Civil Rights Movement: They
                were going to do their jail time and not put up a bond. That was the first I knew about that. Because in these days, the
                lawyers had to walk a fine line between what they could tell their clients and what the clients would tell them. So, the
                first time I found out about “jail without bail” was after the conviction, as I recall it. I know I was shocked.And, uh,
                I was shocked for a number of reasons. There was another organization involved in that Rock Hill [someone coughs] community
                called SNCC, Student Nonviolent Association [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]. [Loud noise from yard work
                equipment begins and continues outside the window.] I didn’t know who was calling the shots for the students, but I know I
                wasn’t and wasn’t going to let myself get boxed-in to, uh, instituting some lawsuit or being available or participating
                in that. But they were ready to do what they were going to do.

                the demonstration aspects of that litigation because of his connection with one of the schools up there and his, uh, the
                fact that he was an athlete of some kind and was worried that he would lose his scholarship.

                You had to be as involved as you possibly could in all aspects of the community. In other words, if you’re going to
                justify your existence as a lawyer, you had to be in a position to articulate the concerns of the various, uh, citizens that
                you would represent. So, I was most closely, I guess, identified with the NAACP, because I was, uh - I knew the leadership
                and the, uh - better. I knew, uh, that the Sumter NAACP was right there. And the Sumter NAACP had a very active involvement
                in the total community. In fact, uh, one of the things that attracted me to Sumter was the fact that, uh, it had an active
                NAACP Chapter.

                Dream a reality in our lifetime. Now, we didn’t succeed in all of that, but, of course, we diligently tried.And, uh, you -
                every time - Matthew [Perry Jr.] and I used to talk about the fact that, uh - I don’t know if we talked about it or we
                reminisced about it. We would say that if a Greyhound bus had had a major wreck in front of our individual offices, we would
                not get the cases more than likely, that they would end up being - become clients of one of the more established law firms.
                And we had to continually work to take the cases that were not significant financially -

                Well, it was another avenue of, uh, opportunity for exposure and to connect yourself with a segment of the population that
                was not - you must remember that, in the days we’re talking about, the headquarters of the White Citizens Council was
                Sumter. And at the same time, as I recall it, some of the white community was very active in the Human Rights Commission.
                Uh, I remember Mr. Dabbs [James McBride Dabbs of Mayesville, South Carolina, who served on the South Carolina Human
                Relations Commission] was very active. So, you would affiliate yourself with everybody who might offer you an opportunity to
                become involved in the struggle for civil rights.

                through the ’60s. The Voting Rights Act obviously gets passed, there are some early - some black candidates stand for
                election, obviously, in various races. Um, and then you will be a delegate - you were a delegate to the Democratic National

                We were disappointed that we did not make more progress. And particularly were we disappointed in the fact that, uh, much of
                the progress we apparently were making did not benefit the most needy of the black community. You know, we - and that’s
                not an ancient story we’re talking about. That’s a current, uh, scenario that, uh, is still an issue.Uh, we have - I
                think, uh, I’ve probably cited it a couple of time. You come out of Spartanburg and you look at the schools in Spartanburg
                County, and you come down to some of the less fortunate counties, and you look at the conditions of our schools, and
                everybody’s talking about the “Corridor of Shame” and various and sundry other aspects of our development. But we
                still need to spend more time, more energy on developing a school system that provides an opportunity for our children, in
                particularly the less fortunate communities, to get the quality of education which will prepare them for, uh, living in the
                next century.

                I could think of to do that was to have a caucus where you meet and study what the rules are and be prepared to meet the
                rules head on. That was , that was why I was active with the other people who were in the caucus in formulating it.

                [Laughs] Well, I had an inside track, because the South Carolina House of Representatives had a hundred and seventy-four
                members, I believe, something like that. The Senate had forty-six. And so, I naturally had an opportunity to work on the
                House. And the opposition was a senator, and he worked on the Senate. And despite the fact that he had been a legislator for
                more years than I had, that I had a larger number of people who were intimately working with me on a daily basis and that
                helped me.

                Abbeville was a novel and involved litigation where some of the school districts in the State of South Carolina sought
                additional support financially. And, uh, at the status of the case when it reached the Supreme Court, we were - those of us
                who felt as I did that, uh, we had to do something to, number one, keep the case alive. We didn’t want it to end up being
                decided and going back and starting all over again. Then, I think I probably was enthusiastic that if the case was kept
                alive, the legislative leaders would have resolved the difference. The dilemma was that the legislative leaders were, by and
                large, from large counties or from counties that had some basic support of education. They had the tax base, and the smaller
                counties had the lesser tax base. And so, you were trying to walk a line where you keep the state involved in providing
                education and not, uh, give them something out that would have prohibited all stock - the state from supporting
                education.And so, I probably said the thing that I have caught the most flack about in my lifetime for - was, uh, providing
                - it was almost as bad as “separate but equal.” And they are still fighting that battle. They have not resolved that
                battle. There is no way - there’s - it’s going to be difficult to get the counties that have the tax base to share with
                the counties that don’t have the tax base, uh, their tax bases. You know? How are they going - how are they going to
                justify to their constituents supporting, uh, those constituents that they don’t represent? That’s the dilemma with
                which we were confronted with.

                On efforts to kind of push back against voucher proposals. And I - I’m thinking all the way back to, say, the Millicent
                Brown litigation [Millicent Brown v. Charleston County School District #20, which sought the desegregation of the
                Charleston, South Carolina, public school system], and the question of tuition grants.

                Well, I think what I see most is the fact that somehow or another if South Carolina is going to reach its potential and
                provide its citizens the kind of public education they need, we have got to get to the point where public education becomes
                a crying need, a desirable result. We haven’t reached that yet. We - we’ve got this - the latest controversy from down
                in Charleston is about, uh, what’s that, uh - the, the, the company that, uh - is it Amazon?

                Oh, well, I’m delighted. I’m having a nice time. My children are doing well. And the people have been extraordinarily
                kind to me. And, uh, I think probably the most difficult decisions I made were the fact that, uh, in my years in the
                legislature, I was unalterably opposed to the death penalty. And, uh, as my career has gone ahead, I have had to sentence a
                human being to die. That was the most difficult of the inner struggles that I had.The young man had robbed his grandmother,
                had come into South Carolina and robbed a coin dealer, and then raped one or two women. And, of course, in my new job as a
                circuit judge, I was assigned to try him. And the women he had raped, one of them lived, one died, and that one who lived
                testified against him. A Horry County [South Carolina] jury determined that, uh, the appropriate sanction should be death by
                electrocution. Now, you talk about hard. That was a hard day’s work. But I had taken this oath and I -
