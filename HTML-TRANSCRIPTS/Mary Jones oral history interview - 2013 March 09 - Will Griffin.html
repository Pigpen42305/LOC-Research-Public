                And we knew lots about going to church. And where you worked during the week, and then you went to church on Sundays. And
                from there on to when I got large enough to really go out and work on the farm, the white man’s farm, like gathering nuts,
                and picking cotton, and digging potatoes, as we call it, “pull” corn—also, pecans, gathering pecans. We couldn’t go
                to school [clears throat] when school started like in September. We had to stay and gather the farm. And then, after you
                gather the farm, then you could go to school, and that was around about October or the first of November.

                And she would take quite a few of the children from the neighborhood to do that kind of work and everything. See, they
                trusted her because she had children and she didn’t play.

                But I loved her because she was always so sweet. She kept us in line! So, after eight years old, then that was our job, like
                going out. And sometime before the farm got ready, we would do hoeing bird’s feed.

                That’s like with a—Mr. Kenner, who used to be the mayor here, he had a little farm behind ours, and he would plant
                birdseeds. And they would come up, and we had to hoe the grass from around them. And it was real exciting, because he paid
                us pretty good.

                I’d say about—well, we’d try to get out there before the sun come up, because it’d be so hot. So, I would say around

                Um-hmm. And they would have food for us to eat, uh-huh, so we didn’t have to worry about taking lunches. And we would work

                And it was in walking distance. So, a group of us, we would get together. And all of us lived around in the same
                neighborhood, so we would, you know, get together and walk back to the house. That wasn’t too far. So, we didn’t need a
                chaperone like we did [clears throat] Miss Alice Porter when we went out to do peanuts and cotton and all of that, because
                we all lived right around the neighborhood.

                Okay. So, let’s talk a little bit about when you finally did—once the season was over, and it was time to pick the
                crops, and then you finally got into school, what was the school—what were the schools like?

                The school was—well, we first started in the church, First Bethesda Baptist Church. That’s one of the oldest churches in
                the Southwest Georgia. Matter of fact, Du Bois attended that church—visited, rather.

                And he was so excited about it, about how it was. It was a great big old something, like a barn, that the white folks had
                given us that we could use. They used it first, and they built them a church and then gave that to us.

                time it starts at Albany High, those children from Monroe will be there! I don’t know how they got there. [Laughs] But the
                children got where they didn’t want to sit beside them, you know, in the cafeteria and all of that. And they would spit at
                them and call them all kind of names: monkeys and bears and all of that.

                But when they started that, like you say, they was transferring black teachers over to their schools and white teachers over
                to our schools. But it really didn’t help out too much, because if it was any over there, it wasn’t over one or two
                blacks.And see, everything, you know—like my daughter played basketball when she was going to—I can’t think of the
                junior high—Carver Junior High. But when she went over there, you know, no need of applying, because they wouldn’t have
                any blacks or “monkeys.”

                the different things that go on here in the city went on. So, he finally wanted to know, “Well, McCree, what y’all
                want?”She said, “Well, we’ve been here three times and we tried to tell you,” said, “but you just told your man
                over there,” she said, just like that, “‘the man over there’ to ask us to have a seat.” Said, “And we sat for an
                hour or two, almost two hours, and you never did come. So, we got up and left.” Said, “And we came back again,” said,
                “and the same thing happened.” Said, “You were so busy.” Said, “And then, the third time we came.”And so, he
                said, “Oh, I’m just so sorry,” you know, “I have so much to do.” And so, he apologized, and then he told her, he
                said, “Well, y’all just put the word out,” and everything. He said, “Because nobody has been up here to apply for a
                job.” So, the next time we met, that’s the first thing she wanted to know: Had anybody been up there? He said, “No.”
                So, she said, “Well, I tell you what. You give me some applications.” She said, “I’ll go out and I’ll carry them.
                Will that be alright?” “Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, that’ll be alright!” [Laughter] So, she did, and from that process,
                they did hire five—I think it was five. Uh-huh. So, that was Etris Smith—

                Okay. So, now, when your father comes to get you out of jail, what’s the first thing you do? What do you do? How do you

                I felt so good, I’m telling you, because I wanted to see my children! Because, see, my neighbor next door, she was
                overseeing them, because she had dared me to go to jail. She had known I was going, because I had always said it. I said,
                “Once it hits Albany, I’m sorry!” “You better not to go to jail!” [Laughs]

                Yeah. And so, I was real happy and everything. Now, some of the peoples, I think, lost money in that deal. Because that was
                the first beginning of it where they’d tell you you could put your house, you know, up or either pay. I forget how much
                the fine was.

                But it was so many of us living out there in the projects then, we kind of even—the Movement was going on each night. They

                And we would have that there, plus I worked as one of the voting captains that was—I was the one out there in Washington
                Street Projects that they would tell at the mass meeting who we were going to vote for, because we had our people then,
                uh-huh, the ones that were going to do right and everything. So, then, I would call them and let them know, or either go
                around to their house the next day and let them know who to vote for when they go to vote.

                Okay. So, I guess, just looking back, reflecting back, on Albany’s Movement, the successes and failures—where would you
                pin those, if there were any failures and there were successes?

<p>
                I wouldn’t say failure, because Lord knows where we were before we started, before it began. I would say it was a success,
                because that come up to the schools and all of that; and our peoples, looked like, a lot of them really caught on and began
                to try to do for their children, to bring them up the right way and everything; and then, good jobs opened up and
                everything, because we wouldn’t have no good jobs. If you did, you was—just like the Belk’s department store. We had
                to picket that place for the longest before they would hire any blacks besides cleaning up!

                [Laughs] So, when I go to those stores now—all these stores that you weren’t working in there, not ringing no cash
                register or nothing, only to clean up and go pick up the mail and things like that, and to watch black people when they come
                in.

                One thing: much prayer. And then, sticking together and not going back to them old Uncle Tom ways: Everything that, you

                say, you know, by sticking together—first thing was, like I told you, much prayer. And then, sticking together. And we
                learned how to love more then, because back then, we was kind of off in love, each other. We had gotten where, like, we

                sharing these wonderful stories that you have.

                out, the War on Poverty. President Johnson was the president, and Sargent Shriver was over that program, the Head Start
                Program. Now, they get me stirred up when they start talking about cutting them funds for Head Start!

                Yes, uh-huh, I sure did, and fifteen hours on a master’s. But I promised the good Lord I was going home with that, what I
                got! It was just too hard and I had got too old! [Laughs]
