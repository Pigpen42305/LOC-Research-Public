                    birdseeds. And they would come up, and we had to hoe the grass from around them. And it was real exciting, because he paid
                    us pretty good.

                    They first integrated the high schools here, first. And my oldest daughter, I signed for her to go the second year. And,
                    boy, boy, it was something! The principal, Mr. McNair, he’d call them “little monkeys,” because he said “that’s
                    all he ever called them, and he couldn’t call them nothing else.” And they would have almost a riot every day.And today,
                    I do not understand—okay, it wasn’t too many telephones then in the home, and we didn’t have a cellphone, but every
                    time it starts at Albany High, those children from Monroe will be there! I don’t know how they got there. [Laughs] But the
                    children got where they didn’t want to sit beside them, you know, in the cafeteria and all of that. And they would spit at
                    them and call them all kind of names: monkeys and bears and all of that.

                    Not really. Now, I’m trying to think: Did she have a black teacher over at Albany High? Because that’s been a long time,

                    But when they started that, like you say, they was transferring black teachers over to their schools and white teachers over
                    to our schools. But it really didn’t help out too much, because if it was any over there, it wasn’t over one or two
                    blacks.And see, everything, you know—like my daughter played basketball when she was going to—I can’t think of the
                    junior high—Carver Junior High. But when she went over there, you know, no need of applying, because they wouldn’t have
                    any blacks or “monkeys.”

                    had worked with them in voter registration, helping get peoples to register to vote. Matter of fact, they had a little

                    incident that they asked for when you go down to register—most of the people back then didn’t have an education—you
                    had to learn how to read the, uh—[pause] just a minute.

                    Uh-huh. And about the fourth time—and he knew Mrs. McCree Harris, because she was working at Monroe and was kind of among
                    the different things that go on here in the city went on. So, he finally wanted to know, “Well, McCree, what y’all
                    want?”She said, “Well, we’ve been here three times and we tried to tell you,” said, “but you just told your man
                    over there,” she said, just like that, “‘the man over there’ to ask us to have a seat.” Said, “And we sat for an
                    hour or two, almost two hours, and you never did come. So, we got up and left.” Said, “And we came back again,” said,
                    “and the same thing happened.” Said, “You were so busy.” Said, “And then, the third time we came.”And so, he
                    said, “Oh, I’m just so sorry,” you know, “I have so much to do.” And so, he apologized, and then he told her, he
                    said, “Well, y’all just put the word out,” and everything. He said, “Because nobody has been up here to apply for a
                    job.” So, the next time we met, that’s the first thing she wanted to know: Had anybody been up there? He said, “No.”
                    So, she said, “Well, I tell you what. You give me some applications.” She said, “I’ll go out and I’ll carry them.
                    Will that be alright?” “Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, that’ll be alright!” [Laughter] So, she did, and from that process,

                    Uh-huh. And the reason that came about—the Movement decided to start, you know, going up, talking to them about this,
                    because every week or two, some black man got killed. All you had to do was stumble across their floor there, and they would
                    kill you.

                    Street by the old jail, which was on—um, I can’t think of the name of that street now, but I know it wasn’t

                    don’t stop that singing and go home, you’re going be locked up!” And we got louder then. [Singing] “Ain’t gonna
                    let nobody turn me around.” [Laughing] And so, we marched around about two more times, and sure enough, they told us we
                    was under arrest.And back then, the jail was so small, they had a little place in the back about—it wasn’t big as—it
                    was about big as from where he’s sitting over here. And that’s where they put 700 of us.

                    throw the bread on top of it. And that’s what they gave us to eat like that—grits and bread and peas, black-eyed peas,
                    like that. And we were so tired down there. We were just—oooh, I tell you the truth, it was rough and tough.But if I had
                    it to do again, I would have done that. Uh-huh, because they were studying marching as we, you know, got out. And I tried to
                    go back, but they wouldn’t arrest me.

                    It didn’t make no difference with them. If you sided with us blacks, like—no, they weren’t calling us blacks then—if
                    you associated with “niggers,” you got just what the “niggers” got. So, they were going to jail.And see, all this
                    came about because our leaders, like the Criterion Club and some ministers and others, had gone down and tried talking with
                    the city manager then—I can’t think of his name—talked with Pritchett and them, you know, about the situation here.

                    But it was so many of us living out there in the projects then, we kind of even—the Movement was going on each night. They
                    would meet at my house at twelve o’clock every day, Sherrod and them.

                    uh-huh, the ones that were going to do right and everything. So, then, I would call them and let them know, or either go

                    Okay. So, I guess, just looking back, reflecting back, on Albany’s Movement, the successes and failures—where would you

                    I wouldn’t say failure, because Lord knows where we were before we started, before it began. I would say it was a success,
                    because that come up to the schools and all of that; and our peoples, looked like, a lot of them really caught on and began
                    to try to do for their children, to bring them up the right way and everything; and then, good jobs opened up and
                    everything, because we wouldn’t have no good jobs. If you did, you was—just like the Belk’s department store. We had
                    to picket that place for the longest before they would hire any blacks besides cleaning up!

                    register or nothing, only to clean up and go pick up the mail and things like that, and to watch black people when they come

                    But they didn’t have to call their name, but they could tell it so plain, because they know who they were. And I would

                    Uh-huh, they played an important role because they didn’t have to worry about nothing. And one thing, we had [laughing]
                    one lady, she was older than me, but she sold Avon. So, she heard about that, and they was telling her what happened. She
                    said, “Well, I can go to jail,” said, “because these folks ain’t buying no Avon and stuff nohow. They ain’t got no
                    money.” Said, “I can go to jail!” So, she did! She went three or four times. [Laughter] And her lights was paid, her
                    rent, and when she got out, she had food and things.

                    do something, but you really didn’t have nothing. Uh-huh! So, I wanted to say that, because they really played an

                    Uh-huh. Because I didn’t do that until after, you know, the Movement, well, during the Movement. That’s when that came
                    out, the War on Poverty. President Johnson was the president, and Sargent Shriver was over that program, the Head Start
                    Program. Now, they get me stirred up when they start talking about cutting them funds for Head Start!
