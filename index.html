                The Digital Oral History and Transcript Analysis Platform is designed to present and analyze a selection 
                of oral history interviews through an intuitive and visually engaging website. With a layout modeled on a 
                clean interactive research environment, the site hosts readable, annotated transcripts and audio files 
                enhanced by modern natural language processing tools. These include keyword frequency tracking, and named 
                entity recognition, helping users explore themes, patterns, and significant terms that emerge organically 
                from the interview content.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project leverages general corpus linguistic methods alongside manual interpretation to bridge the 
                gap between machine analysis and human understanding. Through integration with transcription tools such 
                as OpenAI Whisper and PDF parsing capabilities, the platform automates large portions of data processing 
                while offering editorial oversight. The goal is not only to present archival content but also to interpret 
                itâ€”highlighting historical voices and surfacing previously obscured narratives through interactive 
                visualizations and data-driven commentary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform serves as both a research tool and public history resource. It embeds metadata, interview 
                context, and networked relationships into the digital space, offering insights into the lives and legacies 
                of the interviewees. The user is encouraged to explore both the technical infrastructure of the transcripts 
                and the thematic core of the project, using linked visual tools, graphs, and text analysis widgets to build 
                their own interpretations of the oral history materials.
