                    The Digital Oral History and Transcript Analysis Platform is designed to present and analyze a selection 
                    of oral history interviews through an intuitive and visually engaging website. With a layout modeled on a 
                    clean interactive research environment, the site hosts readable, annotated transcripts and audio files 
                    enhanced by modern natural language processing tools. These include keyword frequency tracking, and named 
                    entity recognition, helping users explore themes, patterns, and significant terms that emerge organically 
                    from the interview content.

                    This project leverages general corpus linguistic methods alongside manual interpretation to bridge the 
                    gap between machine analysis and human understanding. Through integration with transcription tools such 
                    as OpenAI Whisper and PDF parsing capabilities, the platform automates large portions of data processing 
                    while offering editorial oversight. The goal is not only to present archival content but also to interpret 
                    itâ€”highlighting historical voices and surfacing previously obscured narratives through interactive 
                    visualizations and data-driven commentary.

                    The platform serves as both a research tool and public history resource. It embeds metadata, interview 
                    context, and networked relationships into the digital space, offering insights into the lives and legacies 
                    of the interviewees. The user is encouraged to explore both the technical infrastructure of the transcripts 
                    and the thematic core of the project, using linked visual tools, graphs, and text analysis widgets to build 
                    their own interpretations of the oral history materials.
