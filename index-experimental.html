                    The Digital Oral History and Transcript Analysis Platform is designed to present and analyze a selection 
                    of oral history interviews through an intuitive and visually engaging website. With a layout modeled on a 
                    clean interactive research environment, the site hosts readable, annotated transcripts and audio files 
                    enhanced by modern natural language processing tools. These include keyword frequency tracking, and named 
                    entity recognition, helping users explore themes, patterns, and significant terms that emerge organically 
                    from the interview content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project leverages general corpus linguistic methods alongside manual interpretation to bridge the 
                    gap between machine analysis and human understanding. Through integration with transcription tools such 
                    as OpenAI Whisper and PDF parsing capabilities, the platform automates large portions of data processing 
                    while offering editorial oversight. The goal is not only to present archival content but also to interpret 
                    it—highlighting historical voices and surfacing previously obscured narratives through interactive 
                    visualizations and data-driven commentary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform serves as both a research tool and public history resource. It embeds metadata, interview 
                    context, and networked relationships into the digital space, offering insights into the lives and legacies 
                    of the interviewees. The user is encouraged to explore both the technical infrastructure of the transcripts 
                    and the thematic core of the project, using linked visual tools, graphs, and text analysis widgets to build 
                    their own interpretations of the oral history materials.

            <h2>Regional Keyword and Sentiment Analysis</h2>

            <h1>North vs. South in Civil Rights Discourse</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>1. The South Dominates the Discourse</h2>
                <p><strong>“South”</strong> appears nearly 3 times more than <strong>“North”</strong> (1,923 vs. 653 mentions).</p>
                <p>This frequency disparity suggests that the South was more central to the lived experiences and memory
                    of civil rights veterans and participants. It likely reflects the South's status as the primary
                    battleground for systemic racism, legal segregation, and grassroots activism.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The South is not just a region but a central narrative focus—the site of
                    trauma, struggle, and transformation.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Sentiment About the South Is Cautiously Neutral to Mildly Positive</h2>
                <p>Despite the South’s heavy presence, transcripts rich in <strong>"South"</strong> mentions have
                    neutral-to-slightly-positive polarity scores (e.g., 0.08 to 0.13).</p>
                <p>The objectivity scores range from 0.56 to 0.59, indicating a moderate to high level of detachment or
                    analytical reflection.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These narratives often balance emotional experience with factual
                    recounting. While many suffered or witnessed injustice in the South, their tone suggests measured
                    storytelling, possibly shaped by years of reflection or public memory practices.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. The North Is Underdiscussed—But When Mentioned, Likely in Contrast</h2>
                <p>The North's lower mention count suggests it is often invoked in contrast to the South, perhaps as a
                    place of perceived opportunity, safety, or hypocrisy (e.g., “less racist but still unequal”).</p>
                <p>When both are mentioned in the same transcript, the framing often explores the tension between
                    Southern violence and Northern indifference, or how education and mobility differed by geography.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The North plays a comparative role, not a central one. Its function is
                    to define what the South is or isn’t—especially in terms of educational access, civil liberties, and
                    institutional behavior.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Synthesis: What the Sentiment + Frequency Together Reveal</h2>
                <p>The South is emotionally and structurally central to the civil rights memory—it’s where the struggle
                    was lived.</p>
                <p>The neutral-to-slightly-positive sentiment indicates that interviewees don't dwell only on
                    hardship—they also reflect on resilience, community organizing, and change.</p>
                <p>The North appears less as a homeland of freedom and more as a conditional or incomplete alternative—a
                    space of relative but imperfect relief.</p>
