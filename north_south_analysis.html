            <h1>North vs. South in Civil Rights Discourse</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>1. The South Dominates the Discourse</h2>
                <p><strong>“South”</strong> appears nearly 3 times more than <strong>“North”</strong> (1,923 vs. 653
                    mentions).</p>
                <p>This frequency disparity suggests that the South was more central to the lived experiences and memory
                    of civil rights veterans and participants. It likely reflects the South's status as the primary
                    battleground for systemic racism, legal segregation, and grassroots activism.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The South is not just a region but a central narrative focus—the site of
                    trauma, struggle, and transformation.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Sentiment About the South Is Cautiously Neutral to Mildly Positive</h2>
                <p>Despite the South’s heavy presence, transcripts rich in <strong>"South"</strong> mentions have
                    neutral-to-slightly-positive polarity scores (e.g., 0.08 to 0.13).</p>
                <p>The objectivity scores range from 0.56 to 0.59, indicating a moderate to high level of detachment or
                    analytical reflection.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These narratives often balance emotional experience with factual
                    recounting. While many suffered or witnessed injustice in the South, their tone suggests measured
                    storytelling, possibly shaped by years of reflection or public memory practices.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>3. The North Is Underdiscussed—But When Mentioned, Likely in Contrast</h2>
                <p>The North's lower mention count suggests it is often invoked in contrast to the South, perhaps as a
                    place of perceived opportunity, safety, or hypocrisy (e.g., “less racist but still unequal”).</p>
                <p>When both are mentioned in the same transcript, the framing often explores the tension between
                    Southern violence and Northern indifference, or how education and mobility differed by geography.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The North plays a comparative role, not a central one. Its function is
                    to define what the South is or isn’t—especially in terms of educational access, civil liberties, and
                    institutional behavior.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Synthesis: What the Sentiment + Frequency Together Reveal</h2>
                <p>The South is emotionally and structurally central to the civil rights memory—it’s where the struggle
                    was lived.</p>
                <p>The neutral-to-slightly-positive sentiment indicates that interviewees don't dwell only on
                    hardship—they also reflect on resilience, community organizing, and change.</p>
                <p>The North appears less as a homeland of freedom and more as a conditional or incomplete alternative—a
                    space of relative but imperfect relief.</p>
